Creator Notes
Uganda
“No more corruption”
“No more pain”
“Freedom for all my people.”
Those were the lyrics of Johhny Rain’s hit song, Freedom. That was what the fans expected to hear that night at St Mary’s Stadium-Kitende. But instead, they witnessed the rebirth of Johnny Rain. The Johnny Rain who sang freedom died and in his place, a Johnny Rain who was ready to die for freedom was born. Johnny Rain was an ordinary musician who preach the gospel of a better Uganda until the day when just preaching wasn’t enough.
The fans were enjoying their night and getting their money's worth of the ticket when the events of the previous day flashed before him. Suddenly he was back on the road confronting the police officers who beat him up the day before. It was like a trance so real he could touch it. He rubbed his back in the spot where the officer’s baton had assaulted him and he stopped singing. He stopped his set and announced that he was going to talk about his assault by police officers. The crowd roared as he spoke about a revolution and a new Uganda. 
So it began, Johnny Rain the activist was born. Johnny’s tour became as political as it could, he called out top officials on incompetence without fear and his fans praised his courage. One night after a show where he openly criticized the district governor for refusing to take action in the ongoing police scandal, he received a visit from the special forces command. They stormed his hotel dressed in full camo and armed to the teeth. They made their way to the 8th floor where Johnny and his manager, Paulo were. They informed him that the district governor who was a good friend to president Akena was carefully watching him and the next time he would get a visit from them might be his last day.
Johnny was scared, he canceled his tour and when home to his wife, Afiani, and kids as a precaution. At home, he couldn’t focus. He would pace around the house planning his next move. His wife was anxious, she hadn’t seen her husband like this before. After planning, Johnny decided to make an Instagram post. He captioned it, District Governor, Johnny Rain? He started by explaining why he had canceled his tour and then he called out the President. He listed all his grievances with the government. He talked about how the president was ignoring democracy and turning the country into a monarchy. As he sat on the floor of this living room and wrote the Instagram post he felt free and powerful at the same time. He honestly believed that speaking could change something so he kept typing. Paragraph and paragraph, he talked about the governor, the president, and the police without holding back. He sat there and typed all night until he fell asleep.

He woke to Paulo's face. It was really early in the morning. Paulo looked excited as he told Johnny that he was trending. His Instagram post had almost a million likes and people were focusing on the caption mostly. The people wanted him to be district governor. Paulo showed him a video of a little boy who made a video of his grandma saying she would vote for Johnny for president because his music speaks the truth. Johnny didn’t know what to make of the public support he was getting. Everyone knew that people have been killed for daring to run against President Akena but when he looked at his wife across the room as she nodded at him, he knew he was going to it. 
With Paulo by his side, Johnny started his campaign. First uneventful but as he gained more popularity on social media more eyes started to turn to him. He started to get heat from opposition members but he wouldn’t back down. The campaign strategy was social media, the people who loved his music also believed in his dream. At first, the politicians thought it was impossible for a musician to challenge the president and have an actual chance but as his campaign grew, they became scared. 
2 weeks before the election, Johnny and Paulo were out and about in the streets of Uganda when suddenly there were surrounded by army tanks. The armed men came after them but the people on the street formed a human shield and protected Johnny. The soldiers got frustrated and took Paulo away.
Johnny once again cried for help on social media. No one will tell him where his friend was and with the election a few days away, he knew bigger problems were coming. So, when an American-funded network reached out for a tell-all interview, he didn’t say no.
On the day of the interview, he sat next to in front of the camera ready to share all his frustrations. As soon as the interviewer asked the first question everywhere went dark. There was a massive blackout in the entire of Uganda. It was at that moment that Johnny Rain knew he was going to lose. He finally understood why there hasn’t been a free and fair election since 1962. The president had all the power and he even had the power to switch off the power at will.
Election day came and Johnny and his wife went to cast their votes. As he cast his votes he looked at the millions of hopeful people around willing and wishing him to win even though he knew he wouldn’t. His failure was evident yet these people cheered him on as if they were trying to thank him for trying.
When the election results were announced he wasn’t surprised, he sat in his living room with a bottle of scotch to wash down the taste of failure in his mouth. He knew it was over. He had tried and failed. He listened as President Akena congratulated democracy in his acceptance speech and he couldn’t help but laugh.
Suddenly a man stepped into his home. He wondered if it was President Akena’s men here to finish him off. He quickly closed the door to the room where his family was and then he turned to face the man. Then the man said,
“Johnny Rain you great man, raise your head high. This is just the beginning.”
