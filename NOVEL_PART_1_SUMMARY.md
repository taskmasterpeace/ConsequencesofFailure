### INTERCONNECTIONS BETWEEN CHAPTERS

**Rusty → Liu:** Rusty's press conference happened months before Liu's transformation. Liu knows about "the alien warning" when spheres appear.

**Liu → Kaiser:** Both transformed in Year 0. Both carry guilt. Both will become symbols for their nations.

**Kaiser → Johnny:** Kaiser will nominate Johnny for AU Secretary-General. They meet in Year 2. Kaiser sees Johnny as proof non-powered can lead.

**Asha → Rusty:** Asha has seen Rusty's future. She knows if he survives Year 8. She won't tell him.

**Johnny → Asha:** Both believe in hope despite darkness. Johnny's music reaches India, gives Asha something to hold onto.

**All Five:** By the end of Part One, readers know:
- The 8-year countdown (Rusty)
- Living Superweapons are appearing (Liu)
- Africa is organizing (Kaiser)
- The future is terrifying (Asha)
- Hope still exists (Johnny)

### STYLE NOTES (Game of Thrones Approach)

**What I've Implemented:**
- Third person limited POV (deep in character's head)
- Rich sensory details (Beijing rain smell, Australian heat, alien capsule texture)
- Internal monologue revealing character
- Moral complexity (Liu's cowardice, Rusty's burden)
- Foreshadowing (Liu knowing CCP will come, Rusty seeing dual futures)
- Chapter-ending hooks that demand continuation
- No pure heroes (Rusty doubts himself, Liu hid from sister's capture)

**To Continue in Remaining Chapters:**
- Political intrigue (Kaiser's AU campaign, Asha's intelligence work)
- Multiple timelines creating dramatic irony
- Details that pay off later (mongooses, collective memory, songs)
- Cultural authenticity (Nigerian smoking culture, Indian time-travel philosophy, Ugandan rally traditions)

### ESTIMATED TOTAL WORD COUNT

**Completed:**
- Chapter 1: ~4,500 words

- Chapter 4: ~4,000 words
- Chapter 5: ~4,500 words

This creates a substantial novel opening that:
