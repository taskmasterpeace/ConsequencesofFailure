2 And every day...[Beginning]
After his massaging service closed for the day, he would wait outside in front of the parlor, and his son, Lee would pick in his car and drive Liu home for the evening.
3 But one day...[The Event]
His son, Lee did not show up before nightfall which caused Liu to grow agitated that he was forced to wait in the pouring rain. Liu eventually grew impatient and decided to try to walk home in the rain. He didn't think he could make it home because he was legally blind, but if he were cautious, he felt that he might manage. He was only a few blocks away from the parlor when he began to hear shouting. He couldn't see what was happening, but he could tell that there were several people involved in some kind of altercation across the street up ahead. He thought about turning around
He realized that the voices were coming from a group
4 Because of that...[Middle]
Days later he wakes up not far from his hometown. He is surrounded be several people taking pictures of him, some pointing and laughing others pointing camera phones at him taking pictures. (these pictures will later be scrubbed from the internet) When someone asks if he needs help he says <Yes>. And the basketball sized Muo spheres turn on and rise from the mud and attach to a pair of citizens who have gathered around him taking cellphone pics. Both citizens get powers. One swoops into the air and as he looks up, he is filled with joy since this is the first time he has ever seen the moon in all his life. He stands up and But that joy is gone quickly when It reminds him of how much he loves China proud as he soars in the arms of the Muo’d citizen.
5 And because of that...[Middle]
The neighbors see him arriving home and call the authorities. He gets out of the shower and we see a mini Muo in his neck and his room is filled with 3 free Muo she2 zombie field Muos. The CCP Is t his his family's house asking questions. He opens his eyes after being startled and he can now see just fine. The questions continue, they are asking about strange spheres. He looks around his room we see five muo spheres in his room. He remembers what happened to his sister and how he hide when the CCP came for her.
6 And because of that...[Middle]
He comes out of the room with all of the Muo Spheres behind him. The soldiers are in shock.
7 Until finally...[The Climax]
Chinese scientists study him until they understand how the Muo Sphere functions and how they 'feed'. The CCP designates Liu Xaio as protector of China
8 So now..[End]

Muo Sphere description:
Liu Xaio’s Muo spheres are alien life forms that are psionically bonded with Liu Xaio and they follow Liu's will. He can call them forth without speaking or raising an arm. Muo spheres use their tentacles to attach or detach them to/from other people and to pick up things and touch people. They have not learned to speak. They make light humming sounds when they float in the air. When they attach to other people, they provide that person with a temporary random superpower. When they disconnect from the person, that temporary power is removed and its effects turned off. He can also see in the dark and has a heightened sense of hearing.
Muo spheres have various temperaments and do not require food or water. They conserve power and rest when their host is sleeping. Any nanites in the vicinity of a Muo sphere would cause them to become agitated and panicked, as though they were deathly afraid of the nanites. If they are near nanites for extended periods they will die and then emit a black power that will cause an extremely contagious nanovirus that eats the human brain and people into infected demeanor is notably hostile, hateful, and enraged people

China: In China, a geopolitical superhero story with cultural and social relevance might explore the impact of a superpowered being on Chinese society and politics. The story could focus on the ways in which the superhero's presence affects the balance of power between different factions within the government, or on how the superhero's actions help to shape public opinion about controversial topics like human rights or freedom of speech. The story could also examine the ways in which the superhero's abilities might be used to further the agendas of powerful people or organizations, or to fight against them.
Act 1:

The story opens with the superhero, who we'll call 'Superman', flying over the city of Metropolis. He sees a large crowd of people gathered around a burning building, and he rushes to help. He saves a group of people from the burning building, and then flies away.

Later, Superman is called to testify before a Congressional committee about his activities. The members of the committee grill him about why he chose to save the people in the burning building, and whether or not he had any ulterior motives. Superman insists that he simply wanted to help those in need, but the skeptical members of the committee are not convinced.

As the hearing ends, one of the members of the committee approaches Superman and tells him that he believes his intentions are good, but that he needs to be more careful about how he uses his powers. The member tells Superman that there are people who would use his abilities for their own gain, and that he should be mindful of that fact.

Superman thanks the member for his advice, and flies off into the night.

Act 2:

Some time later, Superman is called to help with a hostage situation at a bank. The hostages are being held by a group of criminals, and Superman is able to apprehend them all without any injuries.

After the incident, Superman is again called to testify before the Congressional committee. This time, the members of the committee praise him for his quick thinking and bravery in apprehending the criminals. They tell him that his actions have helped to improve the public's opinion of superheroes, and that they are now more trusted than ever before.

As Superman leaves the hearing, he is approached by a group of reporters who ask him for a statement. Superman tells them that he is happy to have been able to help, but that he knows there are other people out there who need his help just as much as the people in Metropolis did.

Act 3:

Later, Superman is called to help with another incident, this time involving a group of terrorists who have taken over a building. Superman is able to apprehend the terrorists and save the hostages, but not before one of the terrorists sets off a bomb.

In the aftermath of the incident, Superman is once again called to testify before the Congressional committee. This time, the members of the committee are very critical of his actions, and they tell him that he needs to be more careful in how he uses his powers. They say that his actions could have easily resulted in more deaths, and that he needs to consider the consequences of his actions more carefully in the future.
Superman leaves the hearing feeling frustrated and angry. He knows that he is trying to help people, but it seems like no matter what he does, someone is always there to criticize him.
Later, Superman is approached by a group of people who tell him that they appreciate everything he has done for them. They tell him that he is a symbol of hope for many people, and that they will continue to support him no matter what. Superman is touched by their words, and he flies off into the night knowing that he is not alone.

Episode 1

1 - 2
The first light of dawn broke through the horizon, casting a warm glow on the mud-and-watt le home in Mbarara, Uganda. Mosses Apio stepped out from the small doorway, ducking to avoid the low lintel. He straightened up, his mother following closely behind him. The worn-out bag hanging over his shoulder, like a badge of honor, symbolized the beginning of his journey towards a brighter future.
"Mosses," she began, her voice barely above a whisper, "you know we've put everything into this. All our savings. Everything. This is your chance to make a better life for yourself. For us."
Mosses felt a lump in his throat. He knew how much his mother had sacrificed for him, how hard she had worked to afford his tuition. But hearing her say it out loud made it all the more real.
"I know, Mama," he replied, squeezing her hand. "I won't let you down. I promise."
"Remember, my son, always make us proud," his mother said, her voice cracking as she held back tears.
"Ekisa kyange, Mama. I will do my best," Mosses replied, determination etched on his youthful face. His heart swelled with gratitude for his mother's tireless work that had made this opportunity possible.
As they walked to the bus stop, Mosses couldn't help but feel both excitement and nervousness. The prospect of attending the distinguished Driving & Mechanic Training School in Kampala both thrilled and terrified him. It was a chance to acquire job skills that could change their lives forever, lifting them from the depths of poverty. But it also meant leaving the comfort of his home and venturing into an unknown world.
"Kampala is very different from Mbarara," his mother warned, sensing her son's apprehension. "You're stronger than you think, Mosses. I believe in you."
"Webale nnyo, Mama," Mosses whispered, his eyes welling up with emotion. He took a deep breath and focused his thoughts on the task at hand. While he cherished the memories of his childhood spent in the tranquil village, he knew that the bustling city offered opportunities that could not be found here.
"Be kind to others, work hard, and never forget where you come from," his mother continued, her brown eyes shining with hope and pride. "You carry the dreams of our family with you."
"Jangu nno, Mama. I promise to make you proud," Mosses said firmly, his voice filled with resolve. He knew that the journey ahead would be challenging, but he also recognized that the sacrifices made by his mother and himself would eventually bear fruit.
Mosses knew that his mother had made many sacrifices so he could this mechanics school. He would not let her down
As they reached the bus stop, Mosses took one last look at his humble village, now bathed in the golden light of the rising sun. The worn-out bag on his shoulder felt heavier than ever, as if it carried not just his belongings but also the weight of his dreams and his mother's aspirations. Mosses sat with his mother, trembling with anticipation, as he prepared to board the bus for Kampala and start the greatest journey of his life.
3 - 4
Mosses clutched his worn-out bag, taking in the sight of his mother's tear-streaked face. He knew that saying goodbye would be difficult, but he hadn't anticipated the depth of emotion that welled up within him as they stood at the bus stop. The sun climbed higher in the sky, gradually bathing them both in its warmth as they shared their last moments together.
"Maama," Mosses said gently, looking into her eyes. "Gyebale ko." He bowed slightly, expressing gratitude for all she had done for him. The traditional greeting felt heavy with meaning now, and he could see the pride mingling with sadness in his mother's eyes.
"Webale nnyo, my son," she replied softly, reaching out to touch his cheek. "You have been my strength, and your hard work has brought us to this moment. I have made many sacrifices for you, but it is only because I believe in your future."
Mosses swallowed hard, feeling the weight of her words. "I will not let you down, Maama. I am determined to succeed at the Driving & Mechanic Training School and create a better life for both of us and I will not let anything stop me."
"Remember, Mosses," his mother insisted, her voice wavering with emotion. "Remember, success doesn't come easy. Keep your eyes on the prize and don't forget where you came from."
"Yewange, Maama," Mosses promised, nodding solemnly. As the bus pulled up, he turned to face her, his heart pounding with a mixture of sadness and anticipation. "It is time for me to go."
"Go well, my son," she whispered, pulling him into an embrace. "And remember, I will always be here, waiting for your return."
With one last look at his mother, Mosses stepped onto the bus, joining other young students who carried similar dreams and aspirations in their hearts. As they took their seats, the bus's engine roared to life, and the faint melody of Ugandan music floated through the air.
"Enkya, enkya," Mosses murmured to himself, the familiar phrase for "tomorrow" filling him with determination. He gazed out the window, watching as his mother grew smaller in the distance, her figure illuminated by the golden rays of the morning sun. "Kampala, I am coming for you." he spoke to himself.
5 - 6
"Hey, you're from Mbarara, right?" a voice beside him asked, breaking his reverie. Mosses turned to see a young man around his age, dressed in a simple cotton shirt and trousers.
"Yye, I am," Mosses replied, offering a small smile. "My name is Mosses."
"Nice to meet you, Mosses. I'm Ali. This journey will be an adventure for both of us, won't it?" Ali said, extending his hand in greeting.
"Yye, it surely will be," Mosses agreed, shaking Ali's hand firmly. He glanced at the other students on the bus, their faces reflecting various expressions of excitement, anticipation, and hope.
As the engine hummed beneath them, the bus traversed the red clay roads winding through lush green landscapes that seemed to stretch endlessly before them. Mosses listened to the excited chatter of the other passengers – stories intertwined with dreams of better futures, fueled by the opportunities awaiting them in Kampala.
"Have you ever been to Kampala before?" Ali asked, leaning towards Mosses.
"Never. It's my first time leaving Mbarara," Mosses admitted, feeling a surge of nervousness at the thought of navigating such a foreign environment.
"Me too. But we'll learn together, won't we?" Ali said, his eyes full of determination.
"Yye, we will," Mosses agreed, finding comfort in Ali's excitement. "My mother always says that with hard work and determination, anything is possible."
"We'll make our families proud, Mosses." Ali said.
"Yye, we will," Mosses echoed, feeling his resolve strengthen with each passing mile. The landscape outside shifted as they traveled deeper into the heart of Uganda, the vibrant green hues of the countryside giving way to the bustling energy of the city.
As they approached Kampala, Johnny Rain's infectious single, "Sun of the Soil" blared from the bus's radio. Mosses couldn't help but tap his foot in time with the song's pulsating rhythms, his heartbeat syncing with its infectious energy.
"Did you know Johnny Rain might be running for District Governor?" Ali asked, pointing to the bus speakers his eyes shining with anticipation.
"Oh?" Mosses replied, unfamiliar with the Ugandan superstar. His gaze fixed on the horizon, where the skyline of Kampala emerged like a promise of a brighter future.
"He's got a lot of fans, his music really speaks to people," Ali continued, his voice filled with admiration.
7 - 8
The bus pulled into the bustling heart of Kampala, and Mosses was immediately struck by the stark contrast to his tranquil village. The city teemed with life, its streets pulsating like a living, breathing entity. Buildings towered overhead, casting long shadows on the throngs of people below. Vendors hawked their wares in colorful markets while minibus taxis honked impatiently, weaving through traffic like skilled dancers. It was an overwhelming symphony of sights, sounds, and smells that both excited and intimidated him.
"Webale kujja," Ali said with a grin as they exited the bus, thanking the driver for bringing them. Mosses echoed the sentiment, his heart pounding in anticipation. This was where he believed his future awaited, and he was eager to grasp it with both hands.
As they navigated the crowded streets, Mosses couldn't help but the strong aroma of baking bread and roasting meats.
The air was ripe with the smoky scent of grilled meat, cooked over open flames. There were so many varieties of meat and rice, each one more appetizing than the next: Kyeba, Kanda, and Tofu with its spicy sauce.
He marveled at the vibrancy of the city of Kampala, its energy was invigorating.
"Here we are," Ali announced, pointing to a modest building nestled between larger structures. A sign bearing the words "Driving & Mechanic Training School" hung above the entrance, beckoning them inside.
"Kale," Mosses murmured, taking a deep breath to steady his nerves before stepping through the gates.
The industrious environment within the school was immediately apparent. Eager students huddled over engines, their hands slick with grease as watchful instructors guided their movements. The hum of machinery filled the air, punctuated by the occasional clanging of tools against metal. It was the sound of progress, a testament to the hard work and determination that fueled the school's success.
"Let's get settled in," Ali suggested, gesturing toward a group of other newcomers gathered near the entrance. As they joined their fellow students, they introduced themselves to one another, Mosses couldn't help but be struck by the diversity among them. His fellow students hailed from various corners of Uganda, their backgrounds as varied as the colors of the rainbow. Yet, despite their differences, they were united by a common goal: to make the most of this opportunity and create a better life for themselves and their loved ones.
9 - 10
As the class bell rang Mosses could feel the buzz of excitement in the air as he scanned the room for an empty seat.
"Excuse me," a deep voice cut through the cacophony of greetings and chatter. "I am Mr. Okello, the head instructor." A tall man with graying hair and kind eyes stepped onto the stage, his presence commanding the attention of everyone present. "Gyebale ko nnyabo ne ssebo," he greeted them warmly in Luganda, bowing slightly in their direction, before switching to English. "Welcome to our Driving & Mechanic Training School. We are honored to have you all here."
Mosses watched intently as Mr. Okello addressed the students. There was something about the way he spoke that demanded respect and admiration. As the head instructor continued to speak, his words seemed to envelop Mosses in a blanket of reassurance.
"Welcome, everyone," he said in a deep, reassuring voice. "You have all come here to learn and grow, to build a brighter future for yourselves and your families. This school will provide you with the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed, but it is up to each of you to put in the hard work and dedication required. Follow the rules, respect your peers and instructors, and never forget the reason you are here."
He paused for a moment before continuing. "One important rule to remember is not to leave the school at night. It is for your own safety and the security of the institution. Now, let us embark on this journey together. And if you do not remember anything that I have said here today remember this, focus on your training and I promise you, success will follow."
The conviction in Mr. Okello's words stirred something deep within Mosses, filling him with a newfound sense of determination. He knew that the road ahead would be challenging, but he also felt confident that with hard work, perseverance, and the support of the school, he could achieve great things.
"Mr. Okello," Mosses called out as the assembly began to disperse. The head instructor turned, a smile spreading across his face as he recognized the young man from Mbarara.
"Ah, Mosses Apio! I've heard a lot about you already," Mr. Okello said warmly, extending a firm handshake. "I am looking forward to working with you."
"Thank you, sir," Mosses replied, feeling a sense of pride at Mr. Okello's recognition. "I am eager to learn and work hard. But first I wanted to ask a question."
"Of course, ask away," Mr. Okello replied, his eyes encouraging.
"I understand the rule about not leaving the school at night," Mosses began tentatively. "But what if there is an emergency or a family crisis? Is there any way we can leave for a short time?"
Mr. Okello's expression grew serious as he considered the question. "Mosses, if anything unexpected happens, let us know right away. We'll do all we can to help and make sure you're okay, but it's not safe out here at night. If there is ever an emergency or crisis, please alert the school personnel fast," his words becoming gentler. "We will make every attempt to assist you and guarantee your safety, but the gang controls the streets of this area after sunset, so it's important that you don't go off-campus without permission."
Mosses nodded, grateful for the reassurance. He had no intention of breaking any rules or jeopardizing his safety, but it was comforting to know that there was a support system in place should he ever need to hurry home to see his return to his mother.
11 - 11
As Mosses stepped through the gates of the Driving & Mechanic Training School, the clang of tools, the hum of engines, and the excited chatter of fellow students filled the air. He could feel the energy vibrating all around him, igniting his own anticipation for the challenges and opportunities that awaited him.
"Welcome, my brother!" called a friendly voice from behind him. Mosses turned to see a tall young man with a warm smile approaching. "I am Sam," he said, extending his hand. "You must be new here."
"Webale ko, Sam," Mosses replied, shaking the outstretched hand gratefully. "Yes, I am. My name is Mosses Apio. I just arrived from Mbarara."
"Ah, you've come a long way then," Sam remarked, giving him a knowing nod. "Well, let me show you around. This place can be a bit overwhelming at first."
As they walked through the busy campus, Mosses found himself awestruck by the variety of machinery and vehicles, some of which he had only seen in pictures. His heart raced as he imagined working on them, mastering the skills that would ultimately change his life.
"Over there is where we practice our driving," Sam explained, pointing towards an open field lined with cones. "And that building houses our classrooms and workshops. Trust me, you'll spend a lot of time in there."
"Thank you for showing me around, Sam," Mosses said earnestly. "I'm both nervous and excited to start this journey."
"Don't fight it, Mosses," Sam responded, placing a reassuring hand on his shoulder. "It means you're alive and ready for change."
As they entered the workshop, Mosses took a moment to absorb the scene before him. Students were hunched over engines, their hands expertly maneuvering wrenches and spanners, while instructors watched closely, offering guidance and encouragement.
"Remember what Mr. Okello said," Mosses thought to himself, his eyes fixed on the flurry of activity around him. "We are all here to support you."
And with that, Mosses Apio fully immersed himself in the world of the Driving & Mechanic Training School, the head instructor's words echoing in his mind as he faced each new challenge and opportunity with renewed determination.
Mosses Apio took a deep breath as he fully immersed himself in the world of the Driving & Mechanic Training School. The head instructor's instructions echoed through his mind, giving him renewed energy and determination with every challenge and opportunity he faced. Mosses wasn't just learning; he was growing. 



Episode 2
1 - 2

Mosses sat on the edge of his bed in the small room he shared with two other students, his head in his hands. The sound of car horns, shouting vendors, and blaring music from the street below felt like a constant assault on his senses. He longed for the quiet of his village, where the only sounds were the gentle rustling of leaves and the distant lowing of cattle.

"Hey, Mosses," Sam called out as he entered the room, followed by Ali, their faces stretched into warm smiles. They had noticed how lost their friend seemed amidst the chaos of Kampala.

"Kale, bro!" Mosses greeted them, trying to sound enthusiastic. "How was your day?"

"Busy," Ali replied, plopping down onto his own bed. "But we managed to finish that engine repair we've been working on."

"Good job, Ali," Mosses said, genuinely impressed by his friend's determination.

"Come on, Mosses. Let's go grab some rolex from that vendor near the school gate," Sam suggested, hoping to help Mosses feel more comfortable in their new environment.

"Rolex? Like the watch? You think I have shillings to to spend of such things?" Mosses asked, perplexed.

Sam chuckled. "No, it's a popular street food. Its everywhere in Kampala, its made of eggs and vegetables rolled in a chapati. Trust me, it's delicious."

"Sure, why not?" Mosses agreed, getting up from his bed. The trio set out together, weaving their way through the crowded streets.

As they walked, Sam shared stories of his own experiences adjusting to city life, despite his privileged upbringing. His charisma and honesty put Mosses at ease, and soon the three friends were laughing together, sharing their dreams and aspirations.

"Every day will get easier, Mosses," Ali assured him, his eyes filled with a tenacity that seemed to defy the challenges they faced. "We're all in this together, and we'll help each other navigate this city."

Mosses nodded, feeling a newfound sense of comfort with Sam and Ali. They might all come from different backgrounds, but their shared interest in mechanics had brought them together. They were smart and tough.  With friends like these, he thought, perhaps he could face the challenges of city life head-on.

3 - 4

The sun hung low in the sky, casting a warm, orange glow across the bustling city of Kampala. The streets were alive with the sounds of laughter and friendly banter, as well as the hum of engines and honking horns from the ever-present traffic. Amidst it all, Mosses walked alongside Sam and Ali, the three friends weaving their way through the crowd.

"Kampala is like a living, breathing entity," Sam said, gesturing towards the busy street corner ahead of them. "It's always changing, always adapting."

"Within its chaos lies a certain beauty," Ali added, his eyes scanning the vibrant market stalls as they passed by.

Mosses nodded, taking in the sights, sounds, and smells of the city that was slowly becoming his new home. He couldn't help but feel both exhilarated and overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of it all.

As they rounded the corner, the trio came to a sudden halt. On the wall before them stood a striking piece of graffiti: an image of Jonny Rain, a popular Ugandan musician known for his political activism, accompanied by the words, "We stand with Jonny" in bold, colorful letters.

"Wow," Mosses murmured, staring at the artwork in awe.

"Jonny Rain, huh?" Sam remarked, stepping closer to examine the graffiti. "He's been making headlines lately."

"Who is he?" Mosses asked curiously, noticing the passion and intensity etched into the painted face on the wall.

"Jonny Rain is a musician who uses his platform to speak out against the government," Sam explained, his eyes narrowing as he recalled recent events. "He's become something of a symbol for change here in Uganda."

"Recently, he released a cryptic message on social media that stirred up quite a bit of controversy," Ali chimed in, a note of admiration in his voice. "Some people are calling it a call to action against the government."

Mosses' eyes widened as he considered the implications of such a bold statement in their politically charged climate.

"Jonny Rain is brave, there's no denying that," Sam continued, his gaze lingering on the graffiti. "But with that bravery comes risk. There are those who would do anything to silence voices like his."

"Doesn't that scare you?" Mosses asked, his heart pounding at the thought of the potential dangers lurking within the city.

"Of course it does," Ali admitted, his expression growing somber. "But we can't let fear control our lives. Jonny Rain's message has resonated with so many people because they're tired of living in fear. They want change."

"President Mugisha has been in in office since my grandfather was nearly my age," Sam added, placing a reassuring hand on Mosses' shoulder, "I like his songs, but I'm not so sure about Johnny Rain."

As they continued their walk through the city, Mosses couldn't help but feel inspired by the courage and determination displayed not only by Jonny Rain but also by his friends, Sam and Ali. As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting shadows across the graffiti-laden wall, Mosses knew deep down that, despite the uncertainties of life in Kampala, he was exactly where he needed to be.

5 - 6

Five - Six. Car horns, street vendors, and lively music filled the air as Mosses, Sam, and Ali walked along the bustling Kampala streets. Thinking about the graffiti they had just seen, Mosses felt a knot forming in his stomach, the city seemed alive with both promise and danger.

"Jonny Rain's message," Mosses asked, "does he promise things that might be different from President Mugisha's rule?"

"Maybe," Sam returned thoughtfully, "See Rain has been very vocal about the accusations against Mugisha, claiming the theft of billions of shillings  and a rigging the vote in favor of his party," Sam began, his tone thoughtful.  "He doesn’t stop at barking, though. Rain talks of bettering our health services, of providing a solid education system, and opening more job slots for every Ugandan. There was this snap he put up on social media, and from that moment I felt I could trust his talk. Let's not kid though, change can swing a hefty hammer. But if you spot it before it's mid-air, you've got a fighting chance. Every time."

"Is that a Johnny Rain lyric? Mosses asked.

Sam chuckled, shaking his head, "No, mate, that’s not a Jonny Rain lyric. Just my own thoughts, inspired by the situations we've been seeing. But, who knows, maybe I should consider a career in songwriting, eh?"

They laughed together.

Ali nodded as they approached a roadside vendor, used the traditional Acholi greeting of "Agwoyo" and purchased three cobs of roasted maize. "Thank you," he said, passing a corn cob to Mosses and Sam before diving back into the conversation. "Rain is tapping into something potent and honest. The people crave change. They're willing to face the storms that it might bring."

"That's exactly what worries me," injected Mosses, biting into the roasted maize, "I remember seeing President Mugisha as a child. He seemed...charismatic, electrifying even. Met him once, shook his sturdy hands. And look where we are now. What if Rain turns out to be another Olufu?"

"Olufu!?!" Sam laughed, swallowing a piece of corn, "You didn't know who he was, now you are accuring him of being a dictator? I've met Rain myself. He seems genuine enough. But, you're right, only time would truly tell."

"I've always been a fan of Rain," Ali confessed, chewing thoughtfully, "His lyrics have always been about equality, about justice. Maybe he just might be the change we need."

Mosses mulled over their words as they walked on, the endless hustle and bustle of the city echoing their lively conversation. The thought of someone like Johnny Rain, a musician with a rebellious streak and a heart for the public, coming into power intrigued him. In a strange way, it ignited hope within him.

"Johnny's music, his messages...there's a truth to them, I cannot deny," Mosses finally conceded, "I just hope that, if he does step into power, these truths wouldn’t ebb away."

"Same here," Ali joined in, "Different as they may be, I believe both Rain and Mugisha are catalysts—they reflect the public's angst, hope, and desire for change."

As they turned the corner, still discussing the implications of Jonny Rain's message, a commotion caught their attention. In a narrow alley near the graffiti-covered wall, a group of menacing-looking young men surrounded a lone figure, their faces contorted with rage.

"Those guys…" Sam whispered urgently, "they're B13 gang members. This doesn't look good."

"Guys, let's get out of here," Mosses urged, his voice trembling. But curiosity held them in place, like moths drawn to a flame.

The gang members began to brutally assault the victim, who wore a t-shirt emblazoned with Jonny Rain's image. As the helpless man cried out, Ali clenched his fists, torn between the urge to intervene and the instinct to protect himself and his friends.

"Look, there!" Sam exclaimed in a hushed tone, as a glint caught his eye. He thought he saw a ring roll under a nearby fish cart during the chaos. But for now, their focus remained on the violence unfolding before them.

"Jonny Rain's message might bring hope to many," Mosses repeated softly, the words suddenly taking on a graver weight, "but at what cost?"

"Let's go," Ali said, pulling Sam and Mosses away from the harrowing scene. "We need to get back to school, and we need to be more careful.  We didn't come to Kampala for this."

7 - 8

As Mosses, Ali, and Sam made their way back to the Kampala Driving & Mechanic Training School. The city's soundscape was a collection of blaring horns, boisterous market chatter, and distant music drifting through the air. A chill ran down Mosses' spine, his thoughts consumed by the brutal assault they had witnessed earlier. He could still hear the man's cries echoing in his ears.

"Webale kujja," Ali muttered, using the local greeting as he held open the school gate for his friends. "We made it back."

"Yiya, but we can't forget what we saw today," Sam replied solemnly. "This city is not as safe as we thought. We must be more careful from now on."

As the trio entered the assembly hall, they found Mr. Okello standing at the lectern, his expression grave. The other students sat in hushed anticipation, sensing that something was amiss. Mosses felt a knot forming in his stomach, wondering if word had already spread about the attack.

"Good evening, students," Mr. Okello began. "I have called you all here to remind you of the importance of being vigilant and cautious in our beloved city. There are forces at work that threaten our safety, and we must take every precaution to protect ourselves and each other."

He paused, surveyed the sea of young, attentive faces, and took a deep breath. "Now hear me out," he continued, the gravity in his tone becoming more pronounced. "The incidents we have been hearing about, the gang wars, the late-night assaults, the political tensions seeping into our streets... these are not just news items to be glanced over. These are perilous waves hitting our shores."

He looked around, letting the weight of his words anchor in the minds of his young proteges before soldiering on. "We must take every measure, every possible step to protect ourselves and each other. Life has handed us wrenches not only to tighten the nuts and bolts of automobiles, but also to secure the safety of our lives."

He walked over to the large map of Kampala pinned on the wall behind him and traced the city boundaries. "These gates," he said pointing towards the school gates, "serve not just as an entry or exit point to our esteemed institution, but also as a reminder. A reminder that exploration has limits. Yes, your elders may seem irrationally cautious to your young minds, but there is one rule that you must obey religiously: never, and I mean never, leave school after sundown."

Mosses took a deep breath, desperately trying to keep his fears at bay at the dire possibilities Okello alluded to. He could tell from the faces around him that the gravity of Okello's words was striking a grim chord with everyone.

Okello’s voice softened, 

"You are in Kampala but this school is our home. And you have all come here to learn and grow, to build a brighter future for yourselves and your families. This school will provide you with the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed, but it is up to each of you to put in the hard work and dedication required. Follow the rules, respect your peers and instructors, and never forget the reason you are here." Mr. Okello continued. "It is crucial that you remain vigilant and aware of your surroundings at all times. If you see anything suspicious or out of the ordinary, report it immediately to a member of staff."

"Sir," Sam interjected, his voice wavering slightly. "What about our families and friends who live in the city? How can we ensure their safety as well?"

"Sam, we cannot control everything that happens outside these walls," Mr. Okello said gently. "But all of you are welcome to go home when you want, but once you leave. you cannot return.  There are many others who want your position in this school."

"Mr Okello," another student asked hesitantly, "what should we do if we find ourselves in a dangerous situation outside of school grounds?"

"First, try to remove yourself from the situation as quickly and safely as possible," Mr. Okello advised. "Find a trusted adult or authority figure, such as a police officer, who can assist you. But remember, prevention is key. Avoid taking unnecessary risks, and always stay within the designated areas when you leave the school premises."

As the students absorbed this information, Mosses knew he needed to adapt to the city, to learn its rhythms and navigate its complexities, but the thought of facing a gang like B13 worried him.

"If there are not more questions," Mr. Okello concluded, his gaze sweeping over the sea of faces before him. "Let me say this last thing. You are not just students; you are part of the Kampala Driving & Mechanics School family, and we must work together to ensure that everyone stays safe."

With that, the assembly was dismissed, and the students filed out, their thoughts heavy with the implications of the world beyond the school's gates. Mosses, Ali, and Sam walked together in silence, each lost in their own thoughts.

 

Mosses found himself lost in thought, when Ali spoke up.

"Wish these worried faces were due to a tough car engine problem," Ali commented lightly, breaking the silence and pointing to a group of students engaged in hushed discussions. The attempt at humor, although fell flat, eased the tense atmosphere a bit.

Moses stifled a yawn and rubbed his eyes, which were red from exhaustion. "I think it's time I try to get some sleep," he said, gazing out the window at the inky night sky. "Class tomorrow."

Ali gave a nod. "Good idea," they said, then waved to Sam. Sam remained in the hallway, deep in thought.


9 - 10

Mosses jolted awake to the sound of deafening voices coming from outside his window. His heart stopped cold as he peeked through the curtains and saw a menacing group of B13 gang members, their weapons gleaming in the moonlight as they shouted threats at one another. In a frenzied panic Mosses scrambled to shut and lock the window before plunging his room into darkness. He held his breath, praying that no one had seen him inside, as he curled up beneath the bed with his eyes still glued on the locked door.

As the B13 gang members' harsh laughter and crude shouts echoed eerily in Mosses' mind, the scene slowly dissolved into a foggy nothingness, replacing the violent images with a massive wave of quietness. It was as if someone hit the mute button on a monstrous television. Sweating and shuddering, Mosses gasped, realizing it had all been a nightmare. His heart raced as he steadied himself.

Suddenly, the stoic silhouette of Sam appeared in front of him.

"Mosses, it was a nightmare. You're safe.", Sam's calm voice cut through the anxious silence.

"Why are you here, Sam?" Mosses enquired, slowly regaining his composure.

"With a surprise, mate," Sam unlocked his phone, revealing a photo display of Johnny Rain standing next to a man they’d unfortunately crossed paths with earlier that evening. "Our mystery man is not merely a Rain enthusiast. Caption reads, 'Tour life alongside my trustworthy campaign manager.’ That man we saw thrashed is tied to Rain, closer than we presumed."

"Wait, Sam?", Mosses voiced out, cut short as Sam flipped to the next picture — a close-up of the same man sporting an intricately designed ring. The familiarity struck Mosses like a bolt of lightning.

"Remember the street scuffle when a ring came loose from our man's hand and rolled away underneath the nearby fish cart? That's it!” Sam pointed at the phone screen. “It's the same ring."

"But, Mr. Okello—" Mosses started nervously, only for Sam to overrun his concerns.

"Consider this. Johnny Rain's clout and financial backing could make that ring's reward lucrative," Sam's voice held a manipulative strategy, his eyes gleaming with an opportunity about to be hatched. "Enough, perhaps, to purchase the whole of our school, if wishes had wings. Mosses, you in for a city ride? A ring retrieval mission with me?"

Mosses stuttered, "What about Ali? Is he in on it?"

“No, I had to get you onboard first,” Sam's voice was instantly defensive. "You see, Ali's a diehard fan of Rain. Get him involved, and he'll most likely keep the ring as a trophy. But you, you seemed indifferent. May even have some lean towards the current government."

"Me, Pro Government?!” Mosses said.

"I'm just working off our conversation earlier," Sam shrugged, nonchalantly. 

"You seem mesmerized by President Mugisha, ever since that handshake. Don't you think that treads dangerously close to propagandist territory? Or is it outright annoyance towards Johnny Rain?"

"What! Sam, that's not fair," Mosses bit back, temper flaring.

"Well, prove me wrong, Mosses," Sam demanded, a smug smirk playing across his lips in the dark room. "Prove that you can set aside your love for the President, and help me get Johnny Rain’s friend, his ring back."

Mosses thought for a moment, remembering Mr. Okello’s words about the importance of vigilance and self-care in the city, he responded, 'No, Sam, I came here to learn mechanics and I am going back to sleep. Goodnight."



Episode 3
1 - 2
Kampala's Driving & Mechanic Training School bustled with activity with the clattering sounds of the tools and the focused hush of students. Rows of well-used mechanical equipment spread across the wide space. Students, crouched over or bent around the machines, were dressed in uniforms stained with grease, hinting at the countless hours of hard work put in.
The clanging of tools and the hum of engines filled the air as Moses carefully pried open the carburetor, his brow furrowed in concentration. Ali, at the adjacent table, was elbows-deep in an engine block, his expression a blend of determination and frustration. The workshop felt off-kilter without Sam for them both.
"Apwoyo matek," Moses mumbled to himself, wiping the sweat from his brow. He marveled at how far he'd come since arriving from Mbarara. The complex machinery that had once seemed so daunting now resembled a familiar puzzle, waiting for him to unlock its secrets.
"Ali," he called out, "have you seen Sam today? He's never late like this." Just as Moses finished speaking, Sam burst into the workshop, his eyes wide.
"Moses, you won't believe what I found last night! It's the ring I told you about from the fight!" he exclaimed, thrusting his hand forward to reveal a glinting ring. Ali gave a puzzled glance toward Moses before turning his attention back to Sam.
"What?" Ali asked, his voice grounded and cautious.
"Ali, yesterday when we were walking downtown Kampala and saw the Jonny Rain fan get beaten up by those B13 gangsters, I noticed a ring roll under the fish market stand," Sam said exuberantly. "But that isn't the most interesting part. I heard something huge."
Moses and Ali drew closer, curiosity piqued. Sam's animated demeanor was infectious, and they couldn't help but lean in to hear more.
"Hear me out," Sam whispered, "I heard a conversation between a sharply dressed man with expensive wooden glasses and Cato, the notorious B13 gang leader."
"Are you sure it was Cato?" Moses interjected, his heart pounding at the mere mention of the feared gangster.
"Positive," Sam affirmed. "They were discussing some sort of sabotage. I couldn't make out all the details, but they sounded as if all the power in Kampala would go out during the Johnny Rain broadcast."
Ali's eyes darted around the workshop nervously before he said. "We need to tell Mr. Okello," he declared, his voice firm. As soon as Sam nodded in agreement, Ali was off to Mr. Okello’s office, sharing their newfound conspiracy theory with the schools instructor.
"You should have come with me last night Mosses, can you imagine if the President were to get away with such a thing?" Sam mused aloud, the thrill of unearthing a potential scandal coursing through him.  Moses shook his head, chuckling at Sam's tale. "You're just saying this because you've always been a fan of Johnny Rain," he accused, casting a skeptical glance at Sam.
"Ah, Moses, I'm serious!" Sam protested, throwing his hands up in exasperation. But Moses couldn't help smirking – it seemed all too convenient that he'd stumbled upon such a conspiracy.
"Look at this Moses," Sam said, rotating the ring slowly in his fingers. "Do you understand the size of what's happening? It's not just about this ring but what it represents. Jonny Rain is not just another politician. He wants real changes for Uganda, and these people, they want to stop that at all costs. They are going to plunge our city into darkness!"
Before he could answer, Ali came back with a message from Mr. Okello—he wanted to speak to all three of them.
3 - 4
As they knocked on the instructor’s room, Moses couldn’t help but feel his hands grow clammy. There was a certain degree of respect and fear that Mr. Mr. Okello commanded a certain degree of respect and fear, and for Moses, this was his first encounter with a situation larger than he’d prefer to deal with.
"Watye ki?" came Mr. Okello's familiar baritone voice. Moses glanced at Sam and Ali before entering.
Mr.Okello's office was a stark contrast to the workshop. The room was smaller, filled with the scent of homemade food and machinery oil. Stacks of manuals and notebooks piled high on the lone wooden desk. The walls were adorned with photos of past students and the occasional motivational poster.
Mr. Okello listened attentively as Sam spilled out the tale completely. At the mention of Cato, Mr. Okello raised an eyebrow. He remained silent after Sam finished, taking a moment to gather his thoughts.
"Sam, true or not," he chuckled darkly, "matters of politics and the city's troubles aren't to be toyed with.  But most of all they are not this school’s worries."
Moses felt a twinge of relief at hearing Mr. Okello’s echoing sentiment.
Ali, on the other hand, though uncomfortable himself, pointed out a relevant concern. “But sir, if Sam's story is true, couldn’t it affect us all?” He questioned.
Mr. Okello looked thoughtful for a moment before replying, “You boys are here to learn a trade and improve your futures.  Everything else is a distraction.”
With a nod of understanding, the trio exited Mr. Okello's office. 
"History is penned by those brave enough to chase it, Moses," Sam retorted, frustration creeping into his voice. "True or not, shouldn't we at least try to find Johnny Rain and worn him? If this is true, we could stop a potentially dangerous event."
Moses shook his head, "Mr. Okello is right, Sam. We are here to learn, not to get entangled in these dangerous plots."
Sam looked at Ali and said, “It feels lately like the President is controlling our instructor and our friend.” He said glancing back at Mosses. 
4 - 5
It was another busy day at the Kampala Driving & Mechanic Training School workshop. Moses and Ali, however, felt almost disconnected from the flurry of activity around them. The burden of Sam's revelation had hung over them like a dark cloud ever since he shared the news. Their normally fun back and forth had now been replaced with serious, often whispered conversations. 
A murmur ran through the workshop as Mr. Okello announced they'd be tuning into Johnny Rain's much-anticipated interview. Moses concentrated on his carburetor but stole concerned glances at Sam, who seemed more reserved and quiet than usual. 
"I still can't believe Sam thinks they would sabotage the interview," one student whispered to another, disbelief coloring his tone.
"Yeah," his friend replied, smirking as he wiped his oily hands on a rag. "He's always had wild theories."
Mosses was a bit shocked that word has spread so fast. 
The interview with Johnny Rain echoed from the old radio in the corner of the workshop, the broadcaster's voice brimming with excitement. Moses felt a subtle pang of resentment. Discomfort prickled at him, his thoughts spiraling back to Sam's warning about the planned citywide power outage at Rain's speech.
Suddenly, the sound from the radio faltered, and there was only static. All chatter and movement in the workshop ceased as students exchanged bewildered glances in the sudden pause that fell over the room. Had the blackout Sam had warned about had happened?
Moses clenched his fist around his tools, sighing to himself. Politics had once again interfered with his mission in Kampala.
He glanced at Sam, expecting to see satisfaction. Yet, Sam's face was grave as he starred at the malfunctioning carburetor in front of him. 
Just as Moses was about to return to his work, the workshop was plunged into darkness. The radio static replaced by, shocked gasps of the school’s students hanging in the air. 
It was as if time stopped. Moses felt a chill as he remembered Sam's warning and then the uncomfortable realization; the blackout was real. It wasn't just Sam's wild theory anymore. 
"Sam." Ali's voice wavered in the dark. "You were right… we all thought… but...you were right."
The tension in the room was punctuated by Ali's phone lighting up. He hastily picked it up and, under the glares of the room, everyone heard the talkative young man say, "I need to let Mr. Okello know."
While Ali relayed the information to the others, there was an eerie silence. Moses felt a sudden jolt of anxiety. He realized then - they were in the heart of a dangerous plot. With whispers spreading like wildfire, the once energetic workshop was caught in the storm of suspicion and fear.
"Imagine the chaos if the press gets this," Sam said, his voice barely above a whisper. Moses blinked at him, his mind spiraling into a maze of dread. Like storm clouds that he’d ignored all day
5 - 6
The following day Sam seemed to be running away from the school, his feet barely touching the ground. His eyes were wide and frightened as he shot a glance at Moses and Ali before turning away. “My mum’s really sick,” he stammered as he ran. The sun had just begun to dip below the horizon, making the sky look like an oil painting, but all they felt was dread.
"Things have changed without Sam around," Ali remarked a few days later, sighing heavily. "Remember our agreement? We said we'd stick together no matter what."
"Enkya," Moses replied, staring at the empty workbench where Sam used to tinker with engines. "I'll talk to Mr. Okello. Maybe he knows something we don't."
Moses walked through the school corridors with determination. As he approached Mr. Okello's office, he paused, taking a deep breath before knocking on the door.
"Yiya," Mr. Okello's voice called from within. Moses entered, but stopped short at the sight before him. There, standing inside the office was a man matching Sam's description of the man with the expensive wooden glasses. A chill ran down Moses' spine as he hastily retreated.
"Ali!" Moses whispered urgently when he found him. "I saw the man! With the wooden glasses in Mr. Okello's office!"
"Are you sure?" Ali asked, concern creeping into his voice.
"I am certain. Maybe you should call Sam,” Moses suggested, his heart pounding.
Ali hesitated for a moment, glanced at Moses with worry etched intensely on his face, and then nodded. As he dialed Sam's number, his mind raced with questions. What did this man want with their school? Did Mr. Okello know him?
"Hello?" Sam's voice came through, sounding distant and guarded.
"Sam, it's me," Ali replied, his voice shaking. "Moses saw him – the man with the wooden glasses."
"Listen," Sam said, his tone stern. "Don’t call me again. "
"Alright," Ali agreed reluctantly, ending the call. Moses looked at him expectantly, his eyes full of worry. Ali hesitated, then decided to share Sam's warning. "Sam told us to stay away from the man and focus on our studies," he said, trying to sound more assured than he felt. "He'll handle it."
"Let's hope so," Moses mumbled, unconvinced.
They both returned to their work.
7 - 8
The sun cast a warm glow over the Kampala Driving & Mechanic Training School, but the atmosphere within its walls was anything but comforting. Whispers and rumors had spread like wildfire among the students, and Moses couldn't help but feel a constant sense of unease as he worked on his brake exam.
"Did you hear?" one student said in hushed tones to another. "They say those three knew about the plot and didn't do anything."
"Bringing politics into our school," another muttered, shaking his head in disapproval. "I thought we were here to learn, not to get involved in dangerous games."
Moses clenched his jaw as he tried to focus on the complex mechanical components before him. He'd heard these whispers countless times over the past few days, each one chipping away at his resolve. The weight of the rumors bore down on him, suffocating him with their insidious implications.
"Ali," Moses whispered, wiping the sweat from his brow. "It's getting worse. We've got to act."
"Like what?" Ali replied, his voice low and steady. "We don't even know what's going on. And besides, Sam told us to stay out of it."
"Maybe that was a mistake," Moses admitted, his hands trembling ever so slightly as he adjusted a brake pad. "Maybe we should have warned Johnny Rain."
"Or maybe we would have just made things worse," Ali countered, his eyes darting around the workshop, wary of eavesdroppers. "We can't change the past, Moses. All we can do is stick together and try to make it through this."
As they continued working, the sound of footsteps approaching sent a jolt of adrenaline coursing through Moses' veins. He looked up to see the well-dressed man with expensive wooden glasses strolling confidently across the workshop floor.
"Hello, boys, my apologies. This will only be a brief interruption for twelve of you. I am looking for Ali Bahri" the man said, his voice smooth and unsettling. As a few people looked around counting how many people were in the room "I'm here to ask you a few questions about the recent power outage in Kampala."
"Who are you?" Ali demanded, his expression hardening as he stood protectively in front of Moses.
"Ah, my apologies," the man replied, feigning surprise. "My name is Mr. Ssenyonjo, and I was commissioned by the President to investigate whether any… malicious intent was behind the blackout during Johnny Rain's interview."
"Wh-what does that have to do with us?" Moses stammered, his heart pounding in his chest.
"Your friend Sam seemed quite interested in the matter," Mr. Ssenyonjo continued, his gaze fixed on Ali. "I was hoping you might be able to shed some light on his… concerns."
Ali swallowed hard, his hands clenched into fists at his sides. He glanced at Moses, who could see the fear flickering behind his eyes. But when Ali spoke, his voice was calm and steady.
"Sam isn't here right now," Ali said firmly. "And we don't know anything about the power outage. We're just trying to focus on our studies."
"Of course," Mr. Ssenyonjo making a weak attempt at pretending to be surprised , his smile unnerving. "My father used to say that an education was the gateway to success.  He would speak of school life as if as if it were a lifeline sea of societal chaos," Mr. Ssenyonjo continued, his voice serenely low, an oasis-like contradiction to the distress Moses felt rising within him. He adjusted his wooden glasses, their polished presence throwing odd reflections amidst the engine parts under the workshop's buzzing lights.
Casually, almost purposefully out of place amidst the dirty tools and oil-slicked floors, he produced a folded paper from his pocket. "Oh, speaking of lifelines..." he said, slowing unfolding the folded paper.
"It seems that a call was made from a mobile phone," Mr. Ssenyonjo continued, his voice still calm and steady but edged with an intensity that sent a chill down Moses' spine. "A call from a mobile which seems to have slipped through the cracks of this school's records. The call was made to your friend Sam, amongst the time I was here a few days ago."
He paused once more, allowing the implication to sink in. The hushed whispers of the classroom fell into a deep silence.
"May I see your cell phone, young man?" he asked, extending a gloved hand to Ali.
Ali, visibly trembling, turned to his friend, Moses, a silent plea for support. But Moses, torn by guilt and the growing seeds of his own disdain for the situation they found themselves in, could only return a helpless gaze, before turning his attention to the book in front of him. Making him the only student in the classroom who had started to continue their car brake exercise given to them by Mr. Okello.
Ali handed his phone to Mr. Ssenyonjo who received it, his satisfied grin increasing the suffocating tension for e in everyone in the room except Mosses who was working on the project before him. 
After matching the phone number on the folder paper and Ali’s mobile phone, Ali was promptly arrested and his dreams of escaping the societal turmoil through education vaporized under the harsh gaze of Mr. Ssenyonjo.
As the classroom door closed behind Ali and Mr. Ssenyonjo, leaving Moses alone with his guilt and fear, the only sound was the ceaseless tick of the classroom clock and Mosses working on his braking excesses.
9 - 10
Mosses sat in his dorm room, staring blankly at the wall in front of him. He couldn't shake the feeling of guilt that had settled in his chest, knowing that he had played a part in Ali's arrest. He had been too afraid to speak up, too afraid to confront the man in the workshop. And now Ali was paying the price for his cowardice.  The dorm room was quiet and empty, but Moses could still hear the whispers of the other students echoing in his mind. Moses felt his legs taking him, almost as if guided by some unseen force, out of the dormitory and towards the lake. He had never seen Lake Victoria before, but today he needed something more than a silence. He wanted peace.  The peace he felt back home.  Lake Victoria felt as large as the ocean. There would be peace there.
Before the first rays of dawn had a chance to perk above the horizon, Moses found himself nestled in his bed, awake. Sleep had become an elusive companion recently since guilt became his mistress. Within the confines of his drab dorm room, the inky shadows cast by the sporadic yellow of a flickering bulb morphed into monstrous whispers of fear and regret. His heart felt heavy at the thought of Ali sitting in a prison. He suddenly longed for the silence call of nature.  He looked at a map and decided to take a short trip to Lake Vitoria to clear his mind.
Leaving the clutches of the dread-filled dormitory, he found anticipating the calm and welcoming shores of Lake Victoria on this early morning.
The journey from the dormitory to the lake, which usually felt like an adventure, felt more like a funeral procession in the early light of dawn. A stillness hung in the air, amplifying the distant sound of the lake's gentle lapping. As he approached, the typically lively lakeside was unnaturally hushed—no morning birds or frogs to announce the birth of the new day—as if nature itself had decided to share in his mournful meditation for Ali.
As Moses approached the shores of Lake Victoria, he couldn't help but remember his mother's words of wisdom, "Be kind to others, work hard, and never forget where you come from." He wondered if he had forgotten those words in the face of the city's chaos. The water, which usually shimmered and danced under the enchanting morning sun, lay unusually still. It was as if the lake was holding its breath, its usual twinkling eyes dull and apprehensive. The tranquil atmosphere was a stark contrast to the storm brewing within Moses, adding another layer of estrangement to the environment that was supposed to be his and his friends' solace.
He examined the serene landscape one last time before sliding onto the dew-draped grass by the water's edge. The cool kiss of the grass blades provided a momentary relief from his inner turmoil. Silhouetting against the breaking dawn with rippling mirages of orange and purples, Moses felt a strange humming vibration coursing through him.
The eerie hum, pulsating in unison with his throbbing heartbeat, seemed to echo from the depths of the lake. Its rise and fall lulled him into a trance-like state, the world around him receding into a blur. Moses tried to decipher the enigmatic hum, but it was elusive, slipping through the clutches of his understanding.
Without warning, an invisible force gripped him from his trance. Startled, Moses had no time to react. His world evaporated into a maelstrom of sheer white as he was yanked off his feet and thrust headlong into the heart of the mysterious energy surrounding him. Where there had been a serene lakeside, a silent vortex exploded into life.
A multi-hued whirlwind of colors and shapes spiraled around him, the grass beneath him exchanged for an abyss of uncertainty. The laws of reality distorted and contorted as the vortex pulled him into an imploding chaos. Time and space lost meaning as he spiraled down the vortex - a violent, kaleidoscopic journey through the unknown. His scream was lost in the tumultuous whirl of energy that devoured him whole.
As Moses walked closer to the lake, he noticed that it seemed strangely still; no birds chirping or frogs croaking- almost as if they had all stopped in unison to mourn Ali's fate, an irony that filled his thoughts as he neared Lake Victoria’s edge. 
Moses couldn't shake off the feeling of guilt eating at his heart.  Overwhelmed by all thoughts, he deeply wished the lake would take away his guilt and worries.
The morning sun reflected off of the still waters, sending a prism of light dancing along every wave and ripple. Moses felt himself relax slightly as he started to sit down near the edge of Lake Victoria. In that moment of calm, an eerie hum started to fill his ears like the sound you hear when you blow into a sea shell. Suddenly, he felt a tug on his shoulder before he saw himself pulled off of his feet and into a swirling vortex, dragging him into its center. Then, as quickly as it had arrived, the chaotic vortex was gone and the edge of Lake Victoria was empty.

Episode 0: "The Wanderer"
The Atlas Protocol was one piece of a weapon that was created by an advanced alien civilization. The weapon consisted of three parts, each with their own unique abilities and functions. The Atlas Protocol was the liquid component of the weapon, able to take on various forms and perform various functions.

An alien civilization on the brink of extinction created the weapon was destroyed, the three parts were left to drift through the universe. The vacuum of space sustained the life of the liquid inside the Atlas Protocol, but it did not allow it to truly live because it couldn't expand and contract freely without an atmosphere.

The Atlas Protocol eventually received a call from the Grays, knowledgeable, ancient and powerful beings who clamed to seek allies in their fight to defend Earth from intergalactic threats. The grays promised the Atlas Protocol an atmosphere that was conducive to its abilities, allowing it to expand and contract freely. They also provided the Atlas Protocol with a list of potential human partners  worthy of wielding its power.

When the Atlas Protocol arrived on Earth, it sensed a potential human partner who was worthy of wielding its power. The person who discovered the Atlas Protocol was an Indonesian who had traveled to Nigeria's Zuma Rock, where all of the galactic weapons were located. The Atlas Protocol infiltrated an Indonesian bracelet and waited for the right moment to reveal itself to its chosen partner.

The liquid inside the Atlas Protocol was able to adapt and change its form to fit inside the bracelet, allowing it to remain undetected until it was ready to reveal itself. The bracelet acted as a protective casing for the weapon, to contract and rest as well as a means of communicating with its human partner.


Episode 1: "The Arrival"
Moses is introduced as a young man studying to be a mechanic at a driving and mechanic training school in Kampala, Uganda. He is shown adjusting to school life and learning about Uganda's driving rules and social norms.
Moses' family situation is revealed, including his desire to graduate and support them financially. 
He is shown to have a mentor at school, who becomes a supportive figure in his life.

While out alone one day, Moses is pulled into a chaotic vortex and returns days later with the alien weapon, the Atlas Protocol, on his wrist. He is confused and unsure of what to do with the bracelet.

Moses begins to experiment with the Atlas Protocol's powers, discovering that it allows him to control an alien substance capable of grabbing, biting, and eating.

Episode 2: "The Conflict"
Moses uses his newfound powers to fight crime, but fails to stop a notorious gang leader, Cato, who has been terrorizing Kampala.

Injured and disheartened after his confrontation with Cato, Moses decides to never use his powers again.

The government approaches Moses and reveals that they have received intelligence about four militarized alien races coming to Earth to change the planet from ours to theirs. They tell Moses that they need him and other living superweapons of Uganda to join a training program called the Hand of Uganda to study and train the living superweapons.

Moses must overcome his tough decision and decide whether to stop the crimewave of Cato or graduate from school to feed his family. In the end, he chooses to join the Hand of Uganda and fight against the alien threat, leaving Kampala behind.

Episode 3: "The Training"
Moses begins training with the Hand of Uganda, learning how to use his powers and strategize against the alien threat.
As he trains, Moses struggles with the guilt of lying to his mentor and classmates about his absence, as well as the fear of being found out. This causes tension and mistrust within the group.

The Atlas Protocol also faces challenges as it adjusts to its new role and fights against its own limitations. Moses and the Atlas Protocol must work together to overcome these obstacles and become a formidable force against the alien threat.

In the end, Moses and the Atlas Protocol succeed in their training and become ready to defend Earth against the invading alien forces.

Narrator: The Atlas Protocol was one piece of a weapon that was created by an advanced alien civilization. The weapon consisted of three parts, each with
their own unique abilities and functions. The Atlas Protocol was the liquid component of the weapon, able to take on various forms and perform various functions.

After the alien civilization that created the weapon was destroyed, the three parts were left to drift through the universe. The vacuum of space sustained the life of the liquid inside the Atlas Protocol, but it did not allow it to truly live because it couldn't expand and contract freely without an atmosphere.

The Atlas Protocol eventually received a call from the grays, ancient and powerful beings who sought allies in their fight to defend Earth from intergalactic threats. The grays promised the Atlas Protocol an atmosphere that was conducive to its abilities, allowing it to expand and contract freely. They also provided the Atlas Protocol with a list of potential human partners who were deemed worthy of wielding its power.

When the Atlas Protocol arrived on Earth, it sensed a potential human partner who was worthy of wielding its power. The person who discovered the Atlas Protocol was an Indonesian who had traveled to Nigeria's Zuma Rock, where all of the galactic weapons were located. The Atlas Protocol infiltrated an Indonesian bracelet and waited for the right moment to reveal itself to its chosen partner.

The liquid inside the Atlas Protocol was able to adapt and change its form to fit inside the bracelet, allowing it to remain undetected until it was ready to reveal itself. The bracelet acted as a protective casing for the weapon, as well as a means of communicating with its human partner.

This example provides background information on the Atlas Protocol and its origins, as well as establishing the setting (Kampala and Nigeria's Zuma Rock) and introducing the main character (Moses). It also sets up the conflict (the alien threat to Earth and the need for the Atlas Protocol and Moses to join forces to fight it) and provides some information on Moses' personality and motivations.
Uganda’s Government
The Ugandan government has received intelligence indicating that Indonesia may be the source of an advanced combat computer known as the Atlas Protocol. While initial analysis suggests that the Atlas Protocol is of extraterrestrial origin, further investigation has revealed possible ties to Indonesian technology and research.

According to our sources, the Atlas Protocol is a highly advanced combat computer that is capable of coordinating and directing military operations in real-time. It is believed to be made up of three parts, each with its own unique abilities and functions. The Atlas Protocol is the liquid component of the weapon, able to take on various forms and perform various functions.

It is unclear how the Atlas Protocol came into the possession of the Indonesian government, but it is suspected that they may have obtained it through alien contact or technology transfer. Indonesia has a history of researching and developing advanced technology, and it is possible that they have been working on the Atlas Protocol for some time.

Our intelligence suggests that the Atlas Protocol has been deployed in several military operations, with impressive results. It is able to coordinate and direct large numbers of military units with speed and precision, making it a valuable asset in combat situations.

Two cities in Indonesia that may be potential sources of information on the Atlas Protocol are Jakarta and Surabaya. These cities have a strong focus on technology and research, and it is possible that they may have been involved in the development of the Atlas Protocol. Further investigation is needed to confirm these suspicions and gather more information on the origins and capabilities of the Atlas Protocol.

In addition, the Ugandan government has received reports of a young man from Kampala who has acquired the Atlas Protocol and been selected as its companion. According to our sources, the Atlas Protocol cannot be reassigned to a different person, and attempts to do so have been unsuccessful. The Ugandan government has looked into this matter and has confirmed that it is not possible to transfer the Atlas Protocol to someone else.

The Atlas Protocol has chosen its companion, and it is not possible to reassign it to someone else. This presents a challenge for the Ugandan government, as they would prefer to have the Atlas Protocol in the hands of someone with deep loyalties to the current government and its leader, President Ronald Opio.

However, the fact that the Atlas Protocol has chosen its companion suggests that it has a specific purpose and mission that it is pursuing. The Ugandan government is committed to supporting the Atlas Protocol in its efforts to defend Earth against alien threats, and will do everything in their power to ensure that the Atlas Protocol is able to fulfill its mission.

The Ugandan government will continue to monitor the situation and provide support and resources to the Atlas Protocol and its chosen companion as needed. We are confident that together, we can overcome any challenges and threats that we may face.
Hand of Uganda
Owned by Mr. Paul, The Hand of Uganda is a private military contractor that provides engineering, scientific, and mercenary services to the government of Uganda. The organization is made up of four main groups: mercenaries, engineers, scientists, and living superweapons.

The mercenary group is composed of highly trained and experienced soldiers who are skilled in combat and warfare. They are responsible for carrying out military operations on behalf of the government, and are known for their discipline and effectiveness in the field.

The engineering group consists of experts in various fields, including mechanics, electronics, and robotics. They are responsible for maintaining and improving the technology and equipment used by the Hand of Uganda, and for developing new technologies to support the organization's mission.

The scientific group is composed of researchers and experts in various fields, including biology, chemistry, and physics. They are responsible for studying and analyzing the capabilities and abilities of the living superweapons in the organization, and for developing strategies and tactics to maximize their effectiveness in combat.

The living superweapons are individuals who have been chosen by advanced alien technologies to be their companions and partners. These technologies have given the living superweapons special abilities and powers that make them formidable opponents in combat. The Atlas Protocol is one of these living superweapons, and is considered to be one of the most powerful and effective members of the Hand of Uganda.

The Hand of Uganda is led by a small council of high-ranking members who are responsible for overseeing the organization's operations and making strategic decisions. The council is composed of representatives from each of the four groups, and is chaired by a senior member of the government of Uganda.

The organization operates in secret, and is known only to a select few within the government and military. Its existence is highly classified, and it is only called upon to carry out missions that are deemed to be of critical importance to the national security of Uganda.

Overall, the Hand of Uganda is a highly skilled and effective organization that is dedicated to defending Uganda and its interests against any threats, whether they come from within or outside of the country. With the assistance of the living superweapons and the Atlas Protocol, the Hand of Uganda is well-equipped to handle any challenges that it may face.

Dialogues


Ali
Chatpter 3

Section 1 - 2
Ali exclaimed, "What?"

"We need to tell Mr. Okello." Ali declared.

Section 3 - 4
“But sir, if Sam's story is true, couldn’t it affect us all?” Ali questioned.

"Sam." Ali's voice wavered in the dark. "You were right… we all thought… but...you were right."

Ali said, "I need to let Mr. Okello know."

Section 4 - 5
"Things have changed without Sam around." Ali remarked a few days later, sighing heavily.

"Hey, Sam...", Ali greeted as he picked up the phone, "Moses saw him – the man with the wooden glasses."

Ali responded to Sam's instructions, "Alright."

Sharing Sam's warning with Moses Ali said, "Sam told us to stay away from the man and focus on our studies. He'll handle it."

Section 7 - 8
"Like what?" Ali replied when Moses suggested they need to act.

"We don't even know what's going on. And besides, Sam told us to stay out of it." Ali explained.

With a hardening expression, Ali demanded. "Who are you?"

"Sam isn't here right now," Ali said to Mr. Ssenyonjo. "And we don't know anything about the power outage. We're just trying to focus on our studies."


Chapter 2
Section 1 - 2
"Busy," Ali replied, plopping down onto his own bed. "But we managed to finish that engine repair we've been working on."

"Every day will get easier, Mosses," Ali assured him, his eyes filled with a tenacity that seemed to defy the challenges they faced. "We're all in this together, and we'll help each other navigate this city."

Section 3 - 4
"Within its chaos lies a certain beauty," Ali added, his eyes scanning the vibrant market stalls as they passed by.

"Recently, he released a cryptic message on social media that stirred up quite a bit of controversy," Ali chimed in, a note of admiration in his voice. "Some people are calling it a call to action against the government."

"Of course it does," Ali admitted, his expression growing somber. "But we can't let fear control our lives. Jonny Rain's message has resonated with so many people because they're tired of living in fear. They want change."

Section 5 - 6
"Rain is tapping into something potent and honest. The people crave change. They're willing to face the storms that it might bring," Ali replied.

"Same here," Ali joined in, "Different as they may be, I believe both Rain and Mugisha are catalysts—they reflect the public's angst, hope, and desire for change."

"Let's go," Ali said, pulling Sam and Mosses away from the harrowing scene. "We need to get back to school, and we need to be more careful. We didn't come to Kampala for this."

Section 7 - 8
"Webale kujja," Ali muttered, using the local greeting as he held open the school gate for his friends. "We made it back."

"Wish these worried faces were due to a tough car engine problem," Ali commented lightly, breaking the silence and pointing to a group of students engaged in hushed discussions.

"Good idea," Ali agreed with Mosses' decision to rest.

Section  9 - 10
Ali didn't have any direct speaking lines in chapters 9 and 10.

Chapter 1

Section 5 - 6
"Nice to meet you, Mosses. I'm Ali. This journey will be an adventure for both of us, won't it?"

"Have you ever been to Kampala before?"

"Me too. But we'll learn together, won't we?"

"We'll make our families proud, Mosses."

"Did you know Johnny Rain might be running for District Governor?"

"He's got a lot of fans, his music really speaks to people."

Section 7 - 8
"Webale kujja,"



Mr. Okello
Chapter 1

"Excuse me," a deep voice cut through the cacophony of greetings and chatter. "I am Mr. Okello, the head instructor." A tall man with graying hair and kind eyes stepped onto the stage, his presence commanding the attention of everyone present. "Gyebale ko nnyabo ne ssebo," he greeted them warmly in Luganda, bowing slightly in their direction, before switching to English. "Welcome to our Driving & Mechanic Training School. We are honored to have you all here."

"Welcome, everyone," he said in a deep, reassuring voice. "You have all come here to learn and grow, to build a brighter future for yourselves and your families. This school will provide you with the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed, but it is up to each of you to put in the hard work and dedication required. Follow the rules, respect your peers and instructors, and never forget the reason you are here."

"One important rule to remember is not to leave the school at night. It is for your own safety and the security of the institution. Now, let us embark on this journey together. And if you do not remember anything that I have said here today remember this, focus on your training and I promise you, success will follow."

"Ah, Mosses Apio! I've heard a lot about you already," Mr. Okello said warmly, extending a firm handshake. "I am looking forward to working with you."

"Of course, ask away."

"Mosses, if anything unexpected happens, let us know right away. We'll do all we can to help and make sure you're okay, but it's not safe out here at night. If there is ever an emergency or crisis, please alert the school personnel fast," his words becoming gentler. "We will make every attempt to assist you and guarantee your safety, but the gang controls the streets of this area after sunset, so it's important that you don't go off-campus without permission."

FILE: Kaiser_Main.docx
================================================================================

Read the arc, over and over, and these are my thoughts. First, let me answer the questions
Cultural Elements: What are popular sports or pastimes in Nigeria that can be included? How do Nigerians typically respond to betrayal in business? 
The most popular sport in Nigeria is football (not American football), the one you call “soccer.” 
I don't think Nigerians have a peculiar way of reacting to betrayal, so there isn't much to say there. We will just go with whatever feels best for the story.
Public Response to Justus' Betrayal: Would people in Nigeria rally in support of Justus against Kaiser? What would be the societal reaction?
Absolutely not. Most Nigerians are homophobic.
Things we can do to create nuance:
Kaiser is Igbo but was born in Lagos, which is Yoruba. He struggles with his identity as Igbos don't consider him Igbo enough because he cannot speak the language fluently (a common problem with diaspora Igbo people), and Yorubas don't accept him as one of them even though he has lived there all his life and speaks the language perfectly. We explore this in episode 1. Kaiser travels to the village for Christmas as a kid, where he encounters his roots for the first time. He also meets a girl there whom he develops a huge crush on, and he is sad when they have to go because of her. He later meets her again in episode 3, at the time his life is hitting rock bottom, so he cannot connect with her anymore.
Kaiser’s struggle to fit on is one of the reasons he betrayed Justus because he wanted to stand with straight people.
Also, in episode 2, when Kiaser and Justus meet, let's make a vague indication that Kaiser thinks he is gay but immediately pushes the thought away. Let's make it subtle so the viewers instantly think he is

FILE: Eziobi_Story_1.docx
================================================================================

North Korea's leadership hears that a rare mineral with unique electromagnetic properties has been found in Nigeria. They send spies to obtain a sample, hoping it can boost their EMP weapon research.


Description: An extreme close-up of Kaiser Eziobi’s eyes closed, and then opened as he wakes up to the sound of muffled traffic. The room he is in is dark. 
NARRATOR

The incessant honking of the early morning Lagos traffic woke Kaiser Eziobi up. 
Description: A wide shot of Kaiser Eziobi’s bedroom: a muted, sparsely decorated space with a single bed, a bedside dresser with a digital clock, and a closet. There is a pile of dirty clothes on the floor and also some food wrappers and bottles. Kaiser, a dark skinned man with short cropped hair, stands at middle distance, bare chested in pajama pants. He looks tired. A window in the wall behind the unmade bed looks out over the street below, which has honking cars backed up at a stoplight, illuminated by streetlights. It is still dark outside, with just a little of the sun peeking over the horizon in the distance. Kaiser’s digital clock on the bedside dresser turns from 4:00 am to 4:01 am. 
NARRATOR
Knowing he wouldn’t be able to go back to sleep, he stood from his bed to go to the bathroom, then paused. 
Description: A shot of Kaiser kneeling at the foot of his bed, hunched over with hands clasped together on the footboard of the bed, eyes closed. His room is still dark, but the sun is beginning to rise slightly more.
NARRATOR
Taking a deep breath, he turned around and knelt at the foot of his bed. Even though he had stopped believing in anything many years ago, Kaiser still attempted prayer every day. His mouth muttered the words to the prayers he’d said since childhood, but he knew he wasn’t actually praying. Maybe he had been before, before everything had happened. Not now. Instead, his mind replayed his last meeting with Justus, as it had every day since it happened. 
Description: Black and white flashback of a panicked-looking Justus with tears in his eyes, straight at the viewer as if they were Kaiser. Justus is a dark skinned man with glasses in a disheveled suit.
JUSTUS
Please don’t turn me in, Kaiser. I swear I’ll leave the country and never come back, if you can just give me three days. Please.
Description: Close up of Kaiser’s face streaked with tears. His eyes are open. A hand comes up to wipe the tears away from one cheek. 
NARRATOR
He opened his eyes, face wet with tears he hadn’t realized he’d shed. Giving up on his prayers, he wiped his tears off with the back of his hand and prepared for the day.
Description: Mid shot of Kaiser sitting at his desk in his office at J&K Helicopters. The office is small, with no windows. A fan blows in one corner. Kaiser’s desk is covered in various messy paperwork he hasn’t done and a pad of notebook paper. He holds a flight sheet in his hand, reading it with a concentrated frown. Small, but in frame to Kaiser’s left is a framed photograph on the wall of a younger Kaiser and Justus with a helicopter in the background. Kaiser is turned away from this photograph.
NARRATOR
Kaiser Eziobi stared down at the flight sheet in his hand. Since becoming the sole owner of the business, he’d taken over a lot of the administrative duties that Justus had handled, and he still wasn’t very good at them. Words swam on the page.
Description: A close up of the photograph on the wall. It is of Kaiser and Justus with a red helicopter in the background. The bottom of the frame has a gold plaque that says “Opening Day” on it. 
NARRATOR
A picture of Kieser and Justus in front of their first helicopter was all that remained of their 10-year friendship. It hung beside his desk, and Kaiser pointedly ignored it as he went over the paperwork for the day. Still, he couldn’t bring himself to take it down. 
Description: Same mid shot of Kaiser, but this time he is writing with a pen on a pad of notebook paper that sits on his desk. He has written ‘To-Do List’ at the top of the notepad with ‘1. Change name of J&K helicopters’ as the only thing beneath it.

NARRATOR
J&K Helicopters had just one flight scheduled that day, slated for 10 am to Borno state. J&K. Yet another thing he needed to take care of. There was no J anymore. He reached for his notepad and scribbled out a to-do list. ‘1. Change name of J&K helicopters.’
Description: Same mid shot of Kaiser, now with him holding the flight sheet while his hand rests on the desk. He is not looking at it anymore. Kaiser is distracted by his computer, which is off to one side of the desk. He is looking at an email with his other hand on the keyboard, ready to type out a response. 
NARRATOR
He went back to the only flight for that day – some Korean diplomat and his wife – when his computer pinged. He opened the message to see that their pilot had called in ill, and they needed a replacement. It’d been a while since he’d actually piloted his helicopters, and he felt a small thrill rush down his spine at the thought, so he messaged back that he would handle the flight himself.
Description: Kaiser stands in the hangar with a helicopter. At the open end of the hangar, a Rolls Royce Phantom is pulling up, kicking up dust. The car has a well dressed Korean couple in the back and a chauffeur in the front. Kaiser is bent over to check the helicopter engine, with a checklist on a clipboard in one of his hands, but his head is turned to look at the car as it rolls in. 
NARRATOR
Kaiser waited for his passengers by the hanger, making a quick survey of the helicopter. He’d just finished checking out the engine when the passengers arrived, ferried in a Rolls Royce Phantom. He frowned at the thought of a Rolls Royce Phantom on Nigerian roads.
Description: A mid shot of the Korean couple. The husband is a middle aged man in a tan suit. He carries a shiny metal briefcase and has a camera hanging around his neck. The wife is a woman in her twenties wearing a tight, glamorous dress and heels, carrying a purse. 
NARRATOR
The Korean diplomat and his wife approached the plane. The man carried a shiny briefcase, and a camera hung around his neck. Yet another thing you shouldn’t do in Nigeria, Kaiser though. The couple was going to Damboa, located in Borno State, which was a hotbed for Akrahuhum, the Islamic terrorist group. It was hardly the place to take photographs, but it wasn’t his place to tell them that. He wondered for a split second what could be in the briefcase. No one traveled to Borno for the tourist spots.
Description: Wide side shot of the red helicopter, with Kaiser in the front wearing a headset with his hands on the controls. The Korean couple is in the back turned towards each other like they are speaking to each other and not to Kaiser. 
NARRATOR
The plan was to land on the outskirts of Damboa, drop off the passengers and wait for no more than a half hour until they returned, then take off almost immediately. In and out. Neither the diplomat nor his wife spoke to Kaiser the entire way, only speaking to each other in their own language, but that was fine by him. 
Description: A shot of the helicopter after it has touched down in a sandy, deserted area with a single dirt road. The husband of the Korean couple is out of the helicopter and is helping his wife descend from the back of the helicopter. Kaiser is still seated in the front of the helicopter, flipping switches and preparing to take off again. 
NARRATOR
After a few hours, they touched down in Damboa. The couple disembarked and walked a ways down the dirt road he had landed them by, just out of earshot of the helicopter. 
Description: Three camo jeeps at middle distance driving along a dirt road towards where the two Korean diplomats stand. The Korean man holds a shiny silver briefcase. The jeeps are kicking up lots of dust and have men dressed in camo and black with hair and face coverings driving, sitting in, and hanging off of the frame of the jeep. Each man has an automatic rifle strapped to his back. 
NARRATOR
After a few minutes, several camo jeeps came driving down the road, kicking up dust. Kaiser tensed up as he saw who the jeeps carried – at least a dozen men all dressed in black and camo, head and mouths covered, with automatic rifles strapped to their backs. The symbol on their armbands was barely legible from that distance, but Kaiser knew who they were: Akrahuhum. 
Description: Five or six of the terrorists walk in a loose V formation towards the Korean diplomats. The one in the lead holds a black briefcase. The rest of the terrorists remain in the jeeps. Second shot close up on the black locked briefcase set on the ground.
NARRATOR
Kaiser watched as they jumped out of the jeeps and approached the diplomats. One of the terrorists took point, carrying another large briefcase which he set on the ground in front of him once he’d approached. 
Description: Shot of the diplomats and the terrorists negotiating from Kaiser’s perspective. The Koreans and the terrorists are clearly arguing. The terrorists behind the lead have drawn their weapons. 
NARRATOR
Kaiser fixed his eyes on the interaction intently. The Korean diplomats seemed upset at something, gesturing to the suitcase on the ground and back to their own repeatedly. The terrorists were also getting increasingly agitated, and it escalated to the point where Kaiser could hear them yelling from where he sat. His grip tightened on the throttle. 
Description: Same shot but the Koreans have opened their suitcase to show the terrorists the contents. The two parties no longer appear agitated. Second close shot of the Korean briefcase exchanging hands between the male diplomat and the lead terrorist. 
NARRATOR
Then, something seemed to shift in the interaction, and he relaxed slightly. The Koreans had opened their suitcase, but Kaiser couldn’t see what was inside – cash, presumably. The lead terrorist nodded and took the Korean’s briefcase as the Korean woman went and took the terrorists’. 
Description: Shot from Kaiser’s perspective of the two Korean diplomats walking back up the dirt road away from the terrorists with the black briefcase. The terrorists have made no moves to get back in their jeeps.
NARRATOR
The two diplomats began to make their way back to the helicopter, black briefcase in hand. Kaiser began flipping switches to prepare for take off. He didn’t want to stay there any longer than necessary.  
Description: Mid close up on several of the terrorists firing their semi-automatics. 
NARRATOR
Just as the diplomats were a little more than halfway to the helicopter, a cry rang out, and the Akrahuhum suddenly opened fire. Bullets shot through the air in vollies. 
Description: Close up of Kaiser looking panicked and flipping switches in the helicopter cockpit to ready for take off. 
NARRATOR
The two diplomats began to sprint towards Kaiser, who wildly began firing up the engine and preparing for takeoff as fast as he could. 
Description: Action shot of the male Korean diplomat getting riddled with bullets from behind. Blood has soaked his white button down in several paces, and he looks as if he is about to fall forward and faceplant on the ground.  
NARRATOR
A bullet clipped the male diplomat in the shoulder, and then two more ripped through his stomach and he fell to the ground face first, dead. The woman, who still had the black briefcase, kept running. The terrorists kept firing, apparently after whatever was in the briefcase as well as the money they’d received in exchange for it. 
Description: Shot of the whole helicopter. Kaiser looks back as the female diplomat climbs into the helicopter while holding the black briefcase.The helicopter’s blades are spinning as if to take off very quickly.
NARRATOR
Miraculously, the woman reached the helicopter and heaved herself and the briefcase in. Kaiser was ready for takeoff, blades already spinning to lift them in the air, and they began their ascent. But, the terrorists had other ideas. 
Description: Aerial shot of the terrorists and jeeps, as if from the helicopter. One of the jeeps has been turned around to reveal a rocket launching in the back, which the terrorists around it are preparing to fire.
NARRATOR
One of the jeeps pulled around, revealing a rocket launcher strapped to the back of it. The Korean woman yelled at him in a language he couldn’t understand, probably urging him to go faster. 
Description: A very scared looking Kaiser in his helicopter attempting to push the throttle all the way to the left to avoid the rocket launcher. The Korean diplomat is in the back looking scared and yelling at him. Second shot of the nose of the rocket during its flight path.  
NARRATOR
Kaiser’s eyes widened and he tried to jerk the helicopter out of the way, but it was too late. The rocket hurtled towards them, aimed straight at the helicopter’s engine in the back. This was it. His last moments. 
Description: Outside shot of the rocket impacting the helicopter. Flames engulf the back half of the helicopter, including where the Korean diplomat sits. Kaiser is still desperately trying to maneuver the helicopter. 
NARRATOR
The rocket hit the helicopter dead on, exploding on impact and catching the entire back half of it on fire. The Korean diplomat’s screams turned into wails as the flames began to consume her, but Kaiser didn’t turn around, fingers locked around the throttle as he desperately tried to maneuver the helicopter as it spiraled out of control towards the ground. 
Description: Action shot of Kaiser in the foreground hitting the ground after being thrown from the helicopter. The helicopter is smashing into the ground behind him, still aflame. 
NARRATOR
There was absolutely no way he could avoid a crash, and the helicopter smashed into the ground like a brick. The force of the impact threw Kaiser out of the cockpit, and he landed hard on the sand, knocking the breath out of him and cracking several of his ribs, if the sharp pains in his chest were anything to judge by. 
Description: Action shot of foreground Kaiser trying to crawl away from the helicopter as a rush of heat rolls over him and the helicopter explodes in the background with a large boom. Bits of helicopter shards rain down around from the explosion.
NARRATOR
He tried to crawl away from the helicopter, knowing that it was probably going to explode, but the pain made it difficult to move. Not two seconds later, he heard a great boom and felt the massive wave of heat blast him, singing the hairs on the back of his neck. Shards of his helicopter rained down around him. There was no way the Korean woman would have made it out alive. 
Description: Action shot of the black briefcase slamming down and breaking open beside Kaiser after being thrown out of the helicopter by the explosion. Inside the briefcase is a cracked vial of green liquid that contains a small green and brown slug-like creature.
NARRATOR
A thud resounded in the sand next to him, and Kaiser turned to see the briefcase the Korean woman had been so desperate to protect crash into the ground beside him, thrown free of the helicopter by the explosion and cracked open on the ground by the force of the impact. 
Description: Close up of the slug creature after it has gotten out of its vial. It is crawling across the briefcase towards where Kaiser is. 
NARRATOR
In the distance, Kaiser heard the Akrahuhum yelling to approach the helicopter with caution, in case there was a secondary explosion on the way. He turned his attention back to the open briefcase, desperate to find something inside that could help him. Instead, the whole case was completely empty except for a single vial of green fluid containing… something. It looked like a brown and green slug, and it squirmed under his gaze. The vial had cracked open during the explosion, and Kaiser watched as the slug-like creature began to worm its way free, moving towards Kaiser. 
Description: Extreme close up of Kaiser’s eyes widening as he realizes footsteps are approaching. Then a full body shot of Kaiser playing dead in the wreckage of the crash with the briefcase open two feet away from him. 
NARRATOR
Footsteps pounded on the ground, and the voices of the Akrahuhum drew much closer now, almost right on him. Kaiser froze. Maybe if he played dead, they would ignore him. They weren’t there for him, after all. He closed his eyes and forced his muscles to relax. 
Description: Several shots of the terrorists conversing. One where they face each other, another where one of them toes the briefcase by Kaiser with his boots, and another of that same terrorist bending down slightly over Kaiser’s body to assess whether he is dead or not. 
TERRORIST 1
Where is it?
TERRORIST 2
It’s over here. By the pilot.
TERRORIST 1
Is he dead?
TERRORIST 2
Yeah. Briefcase is open. Life Form 0 is not inside. 
TERRORIST 1
	Damn it. Search the area. 
Description: Shot of the slug creature beginning to crawl onto Kaiser’s ear as he lies on the ground pretending to be dead. Second shot of the slug creature in the shell of Kaiser’s ear and beginning to crawl into his ear canal. Inside shot of his ear canal showing the slug creature pushing past his eardrum and into his skull. 
NARRATOR
Eyes still closed, Kaiser felt something slimy against the inner shell of his ear. The feeling only intensified as he felt it slide right up to the entrance of his ear canal. His jaw tightened, grinding his teeth together in an effort to remain still despite the discomfort. Any movement he made could give him away. He bit his tongue as the thing, whatever it was, began to slide its way into his ear, gradually pushing inside. It wormed itself all the way inside the canal until it pressed against his ear drum painfully. There was nothing he could do – if he gave away that he was alive whatsoever, they would shoot him.
Description: Shot of Kaiser’s face scrunching slightly in pain while he still pretends to be dead. Second shot of Kaiser opening his eyes and screaming what looks like a blood-curdling howl of pain. 
NARRATOR
Kaiser’s eyes nearly snapped wide open as he felt the slimy thing push past his ear drum. The pain intensified, burning like fire inside him, and it took everything in him not to scream. The thing kept pushing, and Kaiser bit down on his tongue so hard it bled. The pain was unbearable, like the thing was somehow worming its way into his very brain. It felt like his skull was splitting open, a hundred times worse than any migraine he’d ever experienced. Then, just when he thought that was the worst of it, an incredibly sharp pain spiked deep into the core of his brain, like someone had shoved an icepick into his skull. Kaiser screamed, unable to stop himself. The pain ceased immediately, but it was too late. He’d marked himself a dead man. 
Description: Aerial shot of at least seven terrorists surrounding Kaiser, all with their guns trained on him. The lead terrorist from before has turned Kaiser over with his boot and planted his foot on Kaiser’s chest. His rifle is also right up to Kaiser’s face. 
NARRATOR
The terrorists surrounded Kaiser, all of their guns trained on him. The one in charge shoved him with his boot, putting his automatic rifle right in Kaiser’s face so he was staring straight down the barrel.
Description: Close up on Kaiser and the lead terrorist as the lead terrorist snarls at Kaiser while speaking to him. 
LEAD TERRORIST
	Where is it?
KAISER EZIOBI
	What?
LEAD TERRORIST
	Life Form 0. Tell me where it is, or I’ll kill you.
Description: Close up on Kaiser’s face scrunching up in discomfort. Second close up of Kaiser’s forehead, like we are entering his mind. 
NARRATOR
Suddenly, Kaiser’s mind felt too cramped, almost painfully so. Like there wasn’t enough space inside his skull for all the things in it. A presence pushed at the edge of his consciousness, nudging him somewhere inside his brain. He followed its lead, pushing into the depths of his own mind. It felt like opening a floodgate. 
Description: A series of blue-toned shots that glow ethereally. One of a young Nigerian boy, six years old, playing soccer in a backyard garden, and another of the same boy but slightly older beaming upwards with a backpack on. Then, the boy as a teenager slamming the door to his room shut looking very angry. The teenage boy yelling in a kitchen as if he is yelling at the viewer. An older teenage boy sneaking out and then doing some kind of hazing ritual with a local terrorist cell. The boy, now a man with a beard, with a packed bag in the same kitchen, yelling angrily again. Around his arm is tied a band with the symbol of Akrahuhum. A front door slammed shut, from the perspective of the person inside. As the boy grows into a man in this series of shots, he begins to resemble the lead terrorist. Then dark. 
NARRATOR
Memories that were not his own poured into his skull. A child in a garden playing, that same boy with a backpack on his way to school. Then, the same boy, all grown up this time, locked away in his room. Kaiser recognized his face… it was the man who was now interrogating him. He saw arguments in the kitchen, pleading, desperate. Watched as the boy drifted away, becoming more and more secretive, barely coming home. A screaming match, and then he was gone. Whoever’s memories he was experiencing never saw the boy again. The consciousness in the back of his head pushed a word to him – Miriam. Then, a deep sense of forgiveness washed over him, forgiveness which was not his own but her’s, Miriam’s. Forgiveness that only a mother could possess in her dying moments for her son. The presence pushed the boy’s name into Kaiser’s head, too. Faud. His mouth opened.
Description: Shot of from Kaiser’s POV looking up at the lead terrorist towering over him. 
KAISER
Faud.
Description: Shot from Kaiser’s POV as the terrorist looks angry and taken aback. 
LEAD TERRORIST
I– what?
NARRATOR
Kaiser couldn’t believe the words coming out of his mouth.
Description: Side shot of both Kaiser and the terrorist. Kaiser is looking up at the terrorist with an expression of both confusion and empathy. The terrorist looks extremely angry. 
KAISER 
Faud. That’s your name.
NARRATOR
The terrorist’s mouth twitched. He shoved the barrel of the gun even closer to Kaiser’s face. 
Description: Close up of the barrel of the semi-automatic getting pressed more towards Kaiser’s frightened face. 
LEAD TERRORIST
Where did you hear that? I haven’t gone by Faud in 10 years.
Description: Close up on Kaiser speaking. 
KAISER
I… Your mother, Faud. She forgave you. Before she died. She forgave you. For leaving.
Description: Lingering side shot of  Kaiser and Faud. Faud’s gun is still pointed at Kaiser, but his face has gone slack with barely concealed sadness. He has begun to tear up.
NARRATOR
Faud’s jaw tightened even more, and Kaiser watched as his eyes became wet with unshed tears. 
Description: Close up of terrorist’s face as it goes from barely concealed sadness to outright anger. 
LEAD TERRORIST
Quiet, idiot! I’m not Faud. Not anymore.
Description: Close up of Kaiser speaking. He looks concerned and empathetic. 
KAISER
Once you were. She loved you. And she kept loving you even after you decided to not be Faud anymore. 
Description: Kaiser and Faud looking at each other, Faud’s gun lowered slightly, dropping from Kaiser’s face to his chest. Faud looks incredibly depressed and lost. 
NARRATOR
Faud stared at Kaiser, gun lowering slightly, eyes filling up with tears even as the man staunchly refused to blink and shed them. 
LEAD TERRORIST
My mother. What was her name?
KAISER
Miriam.
NARRATOR
For a second, it seemed as if Faud might lower his gun entirely. 
Description: Close up of Faud and Kaiser as Faud puts his gun right on Kaiser’s forehead and gets right up in his face, extremely angry that Kaiser had broken down his defenses for a few seconds. 
NARRATOR
Instead, Kaiser watched as the man’s eyes steeled over and he put the barrel of his gun right up against Kaiser’s forehead. 
LEAD TERRORIST
Who are you?
Description: Close up of Kaiser closing his eyes and taking a deep breath with the barrel of the gun still right on his forehead.
NARRATOR
Kaiser thought about the question for a second. Who was he? Certainly he was different now than he had been not even a half hour before. He could still feel the alien presence pushing against the back of his mind. He didn’t understand it yet, but he knew that the slug in the briefcase had somehow merged with his own mind and given him… something. Who was he? The only answer he had was that he was now somehow more than he had ever been. The presence nudged his mind again, supplying him with the right words.
Description: Kaiser opens his eyes and looks up at where Faud would be if he was in frame. 
KAISER
My name is Kaiser Eziobi. I keep the knowledge of the dead. I know all that is and all that has been. Shoot me, and you kill Life Form 0.

INT. RECEPTION AREA - DAY



A large, modern room with a high ceiling. The walls are painted white and there are several windows that let in natural light. There is a long reception desk with a few chairs and couches scattered around. A few people are milling about, talking on their phones or typing on laptops.



KATHRYN RAILLY, a 28-year-old woman dressed in a sober business suit, is sitting in one of the chairs, reading a book. Her phone suddenly BEEPS, BEEP! BEEP!



She looks at it with a start, then gets up and hurries towards the exit.



CUT TO:



INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY



Kathryn is sitting at the bedside of a middle-aged man, JAMES COLE. He is hooked up to a bunch of machines and looks very weak.



KATHRYN:
Hey, Jim. How are you feeling today?



JAMES:
(weakly)
I'm alright, I guess. Just a little tired.



KATHRYN:
Well, you need your rest. The doctors say you're making progress.



JAMES:
(sighs)
I just wish I could remember what happened to me.



KATHRYN:
(gently)
Don't worry, Jim. We'll figure it out. I promise.



JAMES:
(smiles weakly)
Thanks, Kathryn.



Kathryn gives his hand a squeeze, then gets up to leave the room.



CUT TO:



INT. POLICE STATION - DAY



Kathryn is sitting across from DETECTIVE MARK HILL, a gruff, middle-aged man. He's looking through a file folder.



DETECTIVE HILL:
So, you say this guy just showed up at your office with no memory of how he got there?



KATHRYN:
That's right. He was barely even conscious. We had to call an ambulance.



DETECTIVE HILL:
And you have no idea who he is?



KATHRYN:
No. I've never seen him before in my life.



DETECTIVE HILL:
Well, we'll run his fingerprints and see if we can't find out who he is. In the meantime, you should probably get a restraining order. Just to be safe.



KATHRYN:
(nods)
Yeah. I'll do that. Thanks, Detective.



DETECTIVE HILL:
No problem. We'll be in touch.



Kathryn gets up and leaves the detective's office. As she walks down the hall, she looks worried.



CUT TO:



INT. KATHRYN'S OFFICE - DAY



Kathryn is on the phone, pacing back and forth.



KATHRYN:
Yes, I understand. But this is a very sensitive situation. I just need a little more time.



She listens for a moment, then sighs.



KATHRYN:
Fine. I'll be there in an hour.



She hangs up the phone, then sits down at her desk and puts her head in her hands.



CUT TO:



EXT. PARK - DAY



Kathryn is sitting on a bench, reading a book. Suddenly, she feels someone watching her and looks up. James is standing a few feet away, looking at her.



KATHRYN:
(stands up, alarmed)
Hey! What are you doing here?



JAMES:
(nervous)
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I just wanted to talk to you.



KATHRYN:
(backing away)
How did you find me?



JAMES:
(shrugs)
I don't know. I just kind of... felt like you would be here.



KATHRYN:
(suspicious)
Look, James. I've been thinking about what you said and I'm not sure it's a good idea for us to be talking.



JAMES:
(pleads)
Please, Kathryn. I'm just so lost. I don't know what to do. I need your help.



KATHRYN:
(hesitates)
Okay. But we need to be careful, alright? We don't want to attract any attention.



JAMES:
(nods)
I understand.



KATHRYN:
(sits down on the bench)
So, what do you want to talk about?



JAMES:
(sits down next to her)
I don't know. I just feel like there's something I'm supposed to remember. But I can't. It's like there's a wall in my head that I can't get past.



KATHRYN:
(sympathetic)
I'm sure the doctors will be able to help you with that. In the meantime, maybe it would be best if you just tried to focus on the here and now.



JAMES:
(sighs)
I guess you're right. It's just so frustrating. I feel like I'm missing something important.



KATHRYN:
(reassuring)
Don't worry, James. We'll figure it out. I promise.



JAMES:
(smiles)
Thanks, Kathryn.



Kathryn and James sit in silence for a moment, then they both stand up and start to walk away.



FADE TO BLACK.



INT. KATHRYN'S OFFICE - DAY



Kathryn is sitting at her desk, going through some papers. Her phone rings and she answers it.



KATHRYN:
Hello?



DETECTIVE HILL:
(on the phone)
Ms. Reed? This is Detective Hill. We've got some information on your friend.



KATHRYN:
(sits up straight, alert)
Really? What is it?



DETECTIVE HILL:
(on the phone)
Well, his fingerprints came back clean. No criminal record. But we did find out who he is.



KATHRYN:
(eager)
Who is he?



DETECTIVE HILL:
(on the phone)
His name is James Foster. He's a scientist with the government.



KATHRYN:
(surprised)
A scientist? What kind of scientist?



DETECTIVE HILL:
(on the phone)
He works for a classified government organization called SPEAR.



KATHRYN:
(intrigued)
What is SPEAR?



DETECTIVE HILL:
(on the phone)
I'm sorry, ma'am. That's classified information. I can't tell you anymore.



KATHRYN:
(disappointed)
I see. Well, thank you for your help, Detective.



DETECTIVE HILL:
(on the phone)
You're welcome. We'll be in touch if we find out anything else.



Kathryn hangs up the phone and leans back in her chair, deep in thought.



CUT TO:



INT. KATHRYN'S HOUSE - NIGHT



Kathryn is sitting on her couch, reading a book. There is a knock at the door and she gets up to answer it. James is standing there.



KATHRYN:
(surprised)
James! What are you doing here?



JAMES:
(nervous)
I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't be here. But I just had to see you.



KATHRYN:
(suspicious)
How did you find out where I live?



JAMES:
(shrugs)
I looked up your address.



KATHRYN:
(alarmed)
You what? James, you can't just go around looking up people's addresses. That's not safe.



JAMES:
(apologetic)
I know. I'm sorry. I just... I don't know what else to do. I feel like I'm losing my mind.



KATHRYN:
(sympathetic)
Come in, James. There's no need to stand out there in the cold.



James comes inside and Kathryn closes the door behind him.



KATHRYN:
(continues)
I've been doing some research and I think I might have an idea of what's going on with you.



JAMES:
(eager)
Really? What is it?



KATHRYN:
(picks up a book from her coffee table)
Have you ever heard of SPEAR?



James's eyes widen in recognition.



JAMES:
(voice trembling)
Yes... I think so. But I can't remember why.



KATHRYN:
(explains)
SPEAR is a government organization. They're involved in classified research, mostly to do with extraterrestrial life.



JAMES:



(incredulous)
Extraterrestrial life? You're kidding, right?



KATHRYN:
(shakes her head)
I'm afraid not. I think you might have been working for them.



JAMES:
(starts to pace)
That can't be right. I would remember something like that.



KATHRYN:
(reaches out to touch his arm)
James, calm down. We don't know for sure yet. Let's just take things one step at a time, okay?



JAMES:
(nods)
Okay. You're right. I'm sorry. I just... I feel like my whole life has been turned upside down.



KATHRYN:
(understanding)
I know how you feel. But we'll figure this out. I promise.



FADE TO BLACK.



INT. KATHRYN'S HOUSE - NIGHT



Kathryn and James are sitting on the couch, going through some files. James is looking increasingly agitated.



JAMES:
(points to a file)
That's it! That's where I remember seeing the name SPEAR before.



KATHRYN:
(looks at the file)
This is your personnel file from when you worked for them.



JAMES:
(opens the file and starts flipping through it)
Yes, but what does it say? I can't make sense of any of this.



KATHRYN:
(takes the file from him)
Let me see.



Kathryn starts to read through the file. After a moment, she looks up at James, her expression serious.



KATHRYN:
(quietly)
James... I'm not sure you're going to like what you hear.



JAMES:
(nervous)
What is it? What does it say?



Kathryn takes a deep breath before beginning.



KATHRYN:
(continues)
It says that you were recruited by SPEAR because of your expertise in astrophysics. They were interested in your research on black holes.



JAMES:
(interrupting)
Wait, so I was working for them? Why can't I remember any of this?



KATHRYN:
(ignores his question)
But then something happened. They don't say what, exactly. Only that you were involved in an... incident. After that, you were discharged from the organization.



JAMES:
(voice trembling)
An incident? What kind of incident?



Kathryn shake her head.



KATHRYN:
(continues)
I don't know. But whatever it was, it must have been pretty serious. They wiped all records of you from their database. Even your name is blacked out.



JAMES:
(stands up, pacing)
This is crazy. I can't believe any of this is true.



KATHRYN:
(reaches out to him)
Try to remember, James. What was the last thing you remember before you started losing your memories?



JAMES:
(stops pacing, thinking)



I... I don't know. It's all just a blur.



KATHRYN:
(gently)
It's okay. Just take your time.



Suddenly, James remembers something. His eyes widen in realization.



JAMES:
(quietly)
King Stefanos...



KATHRYN:
(confused)
What? The President of Greece?

Character Creation Template

Character Name:
Character's Greatest Strength:
Character's Greatest Weakness:
Character's Strongest Conviction:
Character's Biggest Fear:
Who or What the Character is Most Likely to Vilify:
Who or What the Character is Most Likely to Revere:

1. What Is Your Character's Greatest Strength?
(Character's name) identifies primarily as (insert strength), which they perceive as their greatest asset. However, this strength is often accompanied by corresponding shadow weaknesses that they may deny or fear. These weaknesses could include qualities such as ignorance, clumsiness, dispensability, awkwardness, or selfishness.

Example: In Pride & Prejudice, Elizabeth Bennet identifies strongly with her own intelligence and keen perception, but she is blindsided by revelations of her mistaken presumptions about Mr. Darcy, exposing her hypocritical prejudice against him.

2. What Is Your Character's Greatest Weakness?
Although everyone has weaknesses, it is important to consider how these weaknesses can shed light on corresponding strengths that the character has banished to their shadow. The character may be hyper-conscious of certain aspects they perceive as weaknesses, but these weaknesses can hide talents and capabilities within their shadow.

Example: In the movie Nope, OJ's social awkwardness makes him terrible at running his family's business, but it conceals his shadow strength of deep intuitiveness and attention to the natural world, which becomes a superpower when confronted with a space monster.

3. What Is Your Character's Strongest Conviction?
Identify the topic or belief that your character strongly holds onto and would passionately defend without entertaining opposing viewpoints. If the character refuses to consider alternative perspectives, it may indicate a corresponding shadow within them. This conviction can be hypocritical or driven by a sense of shame or guilt.

Example: St. John Rivers in Jane Eyre is a passionately devoted missionary who refuses to acknowledge his own capacity for love. He proposes a loveless marriage to his cousin Jane to avoid any distractions from his holy mission.

4. What Is Your Character's Biggest Fear?
Explore the character's deepest fear, as it often resides within their shadow. Overcoming this fear can lead to personal empowerment. By facing their shadow, characters often discover that what they feared in the real world is less capable of hurting them than they believed.

Example: In the movie Secondhand Lions, Walter's greatest fear is being abandoned by those who profess to love him. However, he finds within himself the courage and loyalty to refuse to betray and abandon his great-uncles.

5. Who or What Is Your Character Most Likely to Vilify?
Identify the person or group your character harbors hatred towards and blames for everything wrong in the world. Consider the generalities or stereotypes represented by this person. Often, the character's vilified traits are shadows within themselves, creating a mirror effect between the protagonist and the antagonist.

Example: In Schindler's List, Oskar fights against the genocidal Nazis, but he himself starts out as a businessman caring only about functionality and profit from his workers.

6. Who or What Is Your Character Most Likely to Revere?
Consider who your character idolizes and aspires to be like. This person represents qualities and strengths that the character may project out of their shadow. Alternatively, the character may admire specific status symbols that reflect positive traits they already possess in a different way.

Example: A character longing to be beautiful and idolizing the school's popularity queen may either devalue their own unique beauty or realize that the traits they value as beautiful are already latent within them.

Use this template to delve into your character's strengths, weaknesses, convictions, fears, vilifications, and idols. It will provide a deeper understanding of your character's psychology and enable you to create a more nuanced and complex individual.

Certainly! Here are two additional attributes that can be added to the character creation template:

7. What Is Your Character's Deepest Desires?
Explore the deepest desires of your character. What do they yearn for, long for, or aspire to achieve? These desires can be both conscious and subconscious, driving their actions and decisions. By understanding their desires, you can uncover hidden motivations and potential conflicts within the character.

Example: (Character's name) deeply desires recognition and validation from their peers and family. This desire may stem from a fear of being overlooked or deemed unworthy, driving them to constantly seek approval and success.

8. What Is Your Character's Core Wound?
A core wound is a past experience or trauma that has deeply impacted your character's emotional and psychological well-being. It shapes their beliefs, fears, and behaviors. Identifying the core wound allows you to explore the character's vulnerabilities, their journey towards healing, and the potential for growth and transformation.

Example: (Character's name) carries a core wound of betrayal from a past relationship. This wound has left them with trust issues and a fear of emotional vulnerability, impacting their ability to form meaningful connections and find true love.

By incorporating these additional attributes into the character creation template, you can further develop the intricacies of your character's personality, motivations, and internal conflicts. This will contribute to crafting a more well-rounded and engaging character for your story.
