North Korea's leadership hears that a rare mineral with unique electromagnetic properties has been found in Nigeria. They send spies to obtain a sample, hoping it can boost their EMP weapon research.


Description: An extreme close-up of Kaiser Eziobi’s eyes closed, and then opened as he wakes up to the sound of muffled traffic. The room he is in is dark. 
NARRATOR

The incessant honking of the early morning Lagos traffic woke Kaiser Eziobi up. 
Description: A wide shot of Kaiser Eziobi’s bedroom: a muted, sparsely decorated space with a single bed, a bedside dresser with a digital clock, and a closet. There is a pile of dirty clothes on the floor and also some food wrappers and bottles. Kaiser, a dark skinned man with short cropped hair, stands at middle distance, bare chested in pajama pants. He looks tired. A window in the wall behind the unmade bed looks out over the street below, which has honking cars backed up at a stoplight, illuminated by streetlights. It is still dark outside, with just a little of the sun peeking over the horizon in the distance. Kaiser’s digital clock on the bedside dresser turns from 4:00 am to 4:01 am. 
NARRATOR
Knowing he wouldn’t be able to go back to sleep, he stood from his bed to go to the bathroom, then paused. 
Description: A shot of Kaiser kneeling at the foot of his bed, hunched over with hands clasped together on the footboard of the bed, eyes closed. His room is still dark, but the sun is beginning to rise slightly more.
NARRATOR
Taking a deep breath, he turned around and knelt at the foot of his bed. Even though he had stopped believing in anything many years ago, Kaiser still attempted prayer every day. His mouth muttered the words to the prayers he’d said since childhood, but he knew he wasn’t actually praying. Maybe he had been before, before everything had happened. Not now. Instead, his mind replayed his last meeting with Justus, as it had every day since it happened. 
Description: Black and white flashback of a panicked-looking Justus with tears in his eyes, straight at the viewer as if they were Kaiser. Justus is a dark skinned man with glasses in a disheveled suit.
JUSTUS
Please don’t turn me in, Kaiser. I swear I’ll leave the country and never come back, if you can just give me three days. Please.
Description: Close up of Kaiser’s face streaked with tears. His eyes are open. A hand comes up to wipe the tears away from one cheek. 
NARRATOR
He opened his eyes, face wet with tears he hadn’t realized he’d shed. Giving up on his prayers, he wiped his tears off with the back of his hand and prepared for the day.
Description: Mid shot of Kaiser sitting at his desk in his office at J&K Helicopters. The office is small, with no windows. A fan blows in one corner. Kaiser’s desk is covered in various messy paperwork he hasn’t done and a pad of notebook paper. He holds a flight sheet in his hand, reading it with a concentrated frown. Small, but in frame to Kaiser’s left is a framed photograph on the wall of a younger Kaiser and Justus with a helicopter in the background. Kaiser is turned away from this photograph.
NARRATOR
Kaiser Eziobi stared down at the flight sheet in his hand. Since becoming the sole owner of the business, he’d taken over a lot of the administrative duties that Justus had handled, and he still wasn’t very good at them. Words swam on the page.
Description: A close up of the photograph on the wall. It is of Kaiser and Justus with a red helicopter in the background. The bottom of the frame has a gold plaque that says “Opening Day” on it. 
NARRATOR
A picture of Kieser and Justus in front of their first helicopter was all that remained of their 10-year friendship. It hung beside his desk, and Kaiser pointedly ignored it as he went over the paperwork for the day. Still, he couldn’t bring himself to take it down. 
Description: Same mid shot of Kaiser, but this time he is writing with a pen on a pad of notebook paper that sits on his desk. He has written ‘To-Do List’ at the top of the notepad with ‘1. Change name of J&K helicopters’ as the only thing beneath it.

NARRATOR
J&K Helicopters had just one flight scheduled that day, slated for 10 am to Borno state. J&K. Yet another thing he needed to take care of. There was no J anymore. He reached for his notepad and scribbled out a to-do list. ‘1. Change name of J&K helicopters.’
Description: Same mid shot of Kaiser, now with him holding the flight sheet while his hand rests on the desk. He is not looking at it anymore. Kaiser is distracted by his computer, which is off to one side of the desk. He is looking at an email with his other hand on the keyboard, ready to type out a response. 
NARRATOR
He went back to the only flight for that day – some Korean diplomat and his wife – when his computer pinged. He opened the message to see that their pilot had called in ill, and they needed a replacement. It’d been a while since he’d actually piloted his helicopters, and he felt a small thrill rush down his spine at the thought, so he messaged back that he would handle the flight himself.
Description: Kaiser stands in the hangar with a helicopter. At the open end of the hangar, a Rolls Royce Phantom is pulling up, kicking up dust. The car has a well dressed Korean couple in the back and a chauffeur in the front. Kaiser is bent over to check the helicopter engine, with a checklist on a clipboard in one of his hands, but his head is turned to look at the car as it rolls in. 
NARRATOR
Kaiser waited for his passengers by the hanger, making a quick survey of the helicopter. He’d just finished checking out the engine when the passengers arrived, ferried in a Rolls Royce Phantom. He frowned at the thought of a Rolls Royce Phantom on Nigerian roads.
Description: A mid shot of the Korean couple. The husband is a middle aged man in a tan suit. He carries a shiny metal briefcase and has a camera hanging around his neck. The wife is a woman in her twenties wearing a tight, glamorous dress and heels, carrying a purse. 
NARRATOR
The Korean diplomat and his wife approached the plane. The man carried a shiny briefcase, and a camera hung around his neck. Yet another thing you shouldn’t do in Nigeria, Kaiser though. The couple was going to Damboa, located in Borno State, which was a hotbed for Akrahuhum, the Islamic terrorist group. It was hardly the place to take photographs, but it wasn’t his place to tell them that. He wondered for a split second what could be in the briefcase. No one traveled to Borno for the tourist spots.
Description: Wide side shot of the red helicopter, with Kaiser in the front wearing a headset with his hands on the controls. The Korean couple is in the back turned towards each other like they are speaking to each other and not to Kaiser. 
NARRATOR
The plan was to land on the outskirts of Damboa, drop off the passengers and wait for no more than a half hour until they returned, then take off almost immediately. In and out. Neither the diplomat nor his wife spoke to Kaiser the entire way, only speaking to each other in their own language, but that was fine by him. 
Description: A shot of the helicopter after it has touched down in a sandy, deserted area with a single dirt road. The husband of the Korean couple is out of the helicopter and is helping his wife descend from the back of the helicopter. Kaiser is still seated in the front of the helicopter, flipping switches and preparing to take off again. 
NARRATOR
After a few hours, they touched down in Damboa. The couple disembarked and walked a ways down the dirt road he had landed them by, just out of earshot of the helicopter. 
Description: Three camo jeeps at middle distance driving along a dirt road towards where the two Korean diplomats stand. The Korean man holds a shiny silver briefcase. The jeeps are kicking up lots of dust and have men dressed in camo and black with hair and face coverings driving, sitting in, and hanging off of the frame of the jeep. Each man has an automatic rifle strapped to his back. 
NARRATOR
After a few minutes, several camo jeeps came driving down the road, kicking up dust. Kaiser tensed up as he saw who the jeeps carried – at least a dozen men all dressed in black and camo, head and mouths covered, with automatic rifles strapped to their backs. The symbol on their armbands was barely legible from that distance, but Kaiser knew who they were: Akrahuhum. 
Description: Five or six of the terrorists walk in a loose V formation towards the Korean diplomats. The one in the lead holds a black briefcase. The rest of the terrorists remain in the jeeps. Second shot close up on the black locked briefcase set on the ground.
NARRATOR
Kaiser watched as they jumped out of the jeeps and approached the diplomats. One of the terrorists took point, carrying another large briefcase which he set on the ground in front of him once he’d approached. 
Description: Shot of the diplomats and the terrorists negotiating from Kaiser’s perspective. The Koreans and the terrorists are clearly arguing. The terrorists behind the lead have drawn their weapons. 
NARRATOR
Kaiser fixed his eyes on the interaction intently. The Korean diplomats seemed upset at something, gesturing to the suitcase on the ground and back to their own repeatedly. The terrorists were also getting increasingly agitated, and it escalated to the point where Kaiser could hear them yelling from where he sat. His grip tightened on the throttle. 
Description: Same shot but the Koreans have opened their suitcase to show the terrorists the contents. The two parties no longer appear agitated. Second close shot of the Korean briefcase exchanging hands between the male diplomat and the lead terrorist. 
NARRATOR
Then, something seemed to shift in the interaction, and he relaxed slightly. The Koreans had opened their suitcase, but Kaiser couldn’t see what was inside – cash, presumably. The lead terrorist nodded and took the Korean’s briefcase as the Korean woman went and took the terrorists’. 
Description: Shot from Kaiser’s perspective of the two Korean diplomats walking back up the dirt road away from the terrorists with the black briefcase. The terrorists have made no moves to get back in their jeeps.
NARRATOR
The two diplomats began to make their way back to the helicopter, black briefcase in hand. Kaiser began flipping switches to prepare for take off. He didn’t want to stay there any longer than necessary.  
Description: Mid close up on several of the terrorists firing their semi-automatics. 
NARRATOR
Just as the diplomats were a little more than halfway to the helicopter, a cry rang out, and the Akrahuhum suddenly opened fire. Bullets shot through the air in vollies. 
Description: Close up of Kaiser looking panicked and flipping switches in the helicopter cockpit to ready for take off. 
NARRATOR
The two diplomats began to sprint towards Kaiser, who wildly began firing up the engine and preparing for takeoff as fast as he could. 
Description: Action shot of the male Korean diplomat getting riddled with bullets from behind. Blood has soaked his white button down in several paces, and he looks as if he is about to fall forward and faceplant on the ground.  
NARRATOR
A bullet clipped the male diplomat in the shoulder, and then two more ripped through his stomach and he fell to the ground face first, dead. The woman, who still had the black briefcase, kept running. The terrorists kept firing, apparently after whatever was in the briefcase as well as the money they’d received in exchange for it. 
Description: Shot of the whole helicopter. Kaiser looks back as the female diplomat climbs into the helicopter while holding the black briefcase.The helicopter’s blades are spinning as if to take off very quickly.
NARRATOR
Miraculously, the woman reached the helicopter and heaved herself and the briefcase in. Kaiser was ready for takeoff, blades already spinning to lift them in the air, and they began their ascent. But, the terrorists had other ideas. 
Description: Aerial shot of the terrorists and jeeps, as if from the helicopter. One of the jeeps has been turned around to reveal a rocket launching in the back, which the terrorists around it are preparing to fire.
NARRATOR
One of the jeeps pulled around, revealing a rocket launcher strapped to the back of it. The Korean woman yelled at him in a language he couldn’t understand, probably urging him to go faster. 
Description: A very scared looking Kaiser in his helicopter attempting to push the throttle all the way to the left to avoid the rocket launcher. The Korean diplomat is in the back looking scared and yelling at him. Second shot of the nose of the rocket during its flight path.  
NARRATOR
Kaiser’s eyes widened and he tried to jerk the helicopter out of the way, but it was too late. The rocket hurtled towards them, aimed straight at the helicopter’s engine in the back. This was it. His last moments. 
Description: Outside shot of the rocket impacting the helicopter. Flames engulf the back half of the helicopter, including where the Korean diplomat sits. Kaiser is still desperately trying to maneuver the helicopter. 
NARRATOR
The rocket hit the helicopter dead on, exploding on impact and catching the entire back half of it on fire. The Korean diplomat’s screams turned into wails as the flames began to consume her, but Kaiser didn’t turn around, fingers locked around the throttle as he desperately tried to maneuver the helicopter as it spiraled out of control towards the ground. 
Description: Action shot of Kaiser in the foreground hitting the ground after being thrown from the helicopter. The helicopter is smashing into the ground behind him, still aflame. 
NARRATOR
There was absolutely no way he could avoid a crash, and the helicopter smashed into the ground like a brick. The force of the impact threw Kaiser out of the cockpit, and he landed hard on the sand, knocking the breath out of him and cracking several of his ribs, if the sharp pains in his chest were anything to judge by. 
Description: Action shot of foreground Kaiser trying to crawl away from the helicopter as a rush of heat rolls over him and the helicopter explodes in the background with a large boom. Bits of helicopter shards rain down around from the explosion.
NARRATOR
He tried to crawl away from the helicopter, knowing that it was probably going to explode, but the pain made it difficult to move. Not two seconds later, he heard a great boom and felt the massive wave of heat blast him, singing the hairs on the back of his neck. Shards of his helicopter rained down around him. There was no way the Korean woman would have made it out alive. 
Description: Action shot of the black briefcase slamming down and breaking open beside Kaiser after being thrown out of the helicopter by the explosion. Inside the briefcase is a cracked vial of green liquid that contains a small green and brown slug-like creature.
NARRATOR
A thud resounded in the sand next to him, and Kaiser turned to see the briefcase the Korean woman had been so desperate to protect crash into the ground beside him, thrown free of the helicopter by the explosion and cracked open on the ground by the force of the impact. 
Description: Close up of the slug creature after it has gotten out of its vial. It is crawling across the briefcase towards where Kaiser is. 
NARRATOR
In the distance, Kaiser heard the Akrahuhum yelling to approach the helicopter with caution, in case there was a secondary explosion on the way. He turned his attention back to the open briefcase, desperate to find something inside that could help him. Instead, the whole case was completely empty except for a single vial of green fluid containing… something. It looked like a brown and green slug, and it squirmed under his gaze. The vial had cracked open during the explosion, and Kaiser watched as the slug-like creature began to worm its way free, moving towards Kaiser. 
Description: Extreme close up of Kaiser’s eyes widening as he realizes footsteps are approaching. Then a full body shot of Kaiser playing dead in the wreckage of the crash with the briefcase open two feet away from him. 
NARRATOR
Footsteps pounded on the ground, and the voices of the Akrahuhum drew much closer now, almost right on him. Kaiser froze. Maybe if he played dead, they would ignore him. They weren’t there for him, after all. He closed his eyes and forced his muscles to relax. 
Description: Several shots of the terrorists conversing. One where they face each other, another where one of them toes the briefcase by Kaiser with his boots, and another of that same terrorist bending down slightly over Kaiser’s body to assess whether he is dead or not. 
TERRORIST 1
Where is it?
TERRORIST 2
It’s over here. By the pilot.
TERRORIST 1
Is he dead?
TERRORIST 2
Yeah. Briefcase is open. Life Form 0 is not inside. 
TERRORIST 1
	Damn it. Search the area. 
Description: Shot of the slug creature beginning to crawl onto Kaiser’s ear as he lies on the ground pretending to be dead. Second shot of the slug creature in the shell of Kaiser’s ear and beginning to crawl into his ear canal. Inside shot of his ear canal showing the slug creature pushing past his eardrum and into his skull. 
NARRATOR
Eyes still closed, Kaiser felt something slimy against the inner shell of his ear. The feeling only intensified as he felt it slide right up to the entrance of his ear canal. His jaw tightened, grinding his teeth together in an effort to remain still despite the discomfort. Any movement he made could give him away. He bit his tongue as the thing, whatever it was, began to slide its way into his ear, gradually pushing inside. It wormed itself all the way inside the canal until it pressed against his ear drum painfully. There was nothing he could do – if he gave away that he was alive whatsoever, they would shoot him.
Description: Shot of Kaiser’s face scrunching slightly in pain while he still pretends to be dead. Second shot of Kaiser opening his eyes and screaming what looks like a blood-curdling howl of pain. 
NARRATOR
Kaiser’s eyes nearly snapped wide open as he felt the slimy thing push past his ear drum. The pain intensified, burning like fire inside him, and it took everything in him not to scream. The thing kept pushing, and Kaiser bit down on his tongue so hard it bled. The pain was unbearable, like the thing was somehow worming its way into his very brain. It felt like his skull was splitting open, a hundred times worse than any migraine he’d ever experienced. Then, just when he thought that was the worst of it, an incredibly sharp pain spiked deep into the core of his brain, like someone had shoved an icepick into his skull. Kaiser screamed, unable to stop himself. The pain ceased immediately, but it was too late. He’d marked himself a dead man. 
Description: Aerial shot of at least seven terrorists surrounding Kaiser, all with their guns trained on him. The lead terrorist from before has turned Kaiser over with his boot and planted his foot on Kaiser’s chest. His rifle is also right up to Kaiser’s face. 
NARRATOR
The terrorists surrounded Kaiser, all of their guns trained on him. The one in charge shoved him with his boot, putting his automatic rifle right in Kaiser’s face so he was staring straight down the barrel.
Description: Close up on Kaiser and the lead terrorist as the lead terrorist snarls at Kaiser while speaking to him. 
LEAD TERRORIST
	Where is it?
KAISER EZIOBI
	What?
LEAD TERRORIST
	Life Form 0. Tell me where it is, or I’ll kill you.
Description: Close up on Kaiser’s face scrunching up in discomfort. Second close up of Kaiser’s forehead, like we are entering his mind. 
NARRATOR
Suddenly, Kaiser’s mind felt too cramped, almost painfully so. Like there wasn’t enough space inside his skull for all the things in it. A presence pushed at the edge of his consciousness, nudging him somewhere inside his brain. He followed its lead, pushing into the depths of his own mind. It felt like opening a floodgate. 
Description: A series of blue-toned shots that glow ethereally. One of a young Nigerian boy, six years old, playing soccer in a backyard garden, and another of the same boy but slightly older beaming upwards with a backpack on. Then, the boy as a teenager slamming the door to his room shut looking very angry. The teenage boy yelling in a kitchen as if he is yelling at the viewer. An older teenage boy sneaking out and then doing some kind of hazing ritual with a local terrorist cell. The boy, now a man with a beard, with a packed bag in the same kitchen, yelling angrily again. Around his arm is tied a band with the symbol of Akrahuhum. A front door slammed shut, from the perspective of the person inside. As the boy grows into a man in this series of shots, he begins to resemble the lead terrorist. Then dark. 
NARRATOR
Memories that were not his own poured into his skull. A child in a garden playing, that same boy with a backpack on his way to school. Then, the same boy, all grown up this time, locked away in his room. Kaiser recognized his face… it was the man who was now interrogating him. He saw arguments in the kitchen, pleading, desperate. Watched as the boy drifted away, becoming more and more secretive, barely coming home. A screaming match, and then he was gone. Whoever’s memories he was experiencing never saw the boy again. The consciousness in the back of his head pushed a word to him – Miriam. Then, a deep sense of forgiveness washed over him, forgiveness which was not his own but her’s, Miriam’s. Forgiveness that only a mother could possess in her dying moments for her son. The presence pushed the boy’s name into Kaiser’s head, too. Faud. His mouth opened.
Description: Shot of from Kaiser’s POV looking up at the lead terrorist towering over him. 
KAISER
Faud.
Description: Shot from Kaiser’s POV as the terrorist looks angry and taken aback. 
LEAD TERRORIST
I– what?
NARRATOR
Kaiser couldn’t believe the words coming out of his mouth.
Description: Side shot of both Kaiser and the terrorist. Kaiser is looking up at the terrorist with an expression of both confusion and empathy. The terrorist looks extremely angry. 
KAISER 
Faud. That’s your name.
NARRATOR
The terrorist’s mouth twitched. He shoved the barrel of the gun even closer to Kaiser’s face. 
Description: Close up of the barrel of the semi-automatic getting pressed more towards Kaiser’s frightened face. 
LEAD TERRORIST
Where did you hear that? I haven’t gone by Faud in 10 years.
Description: Close up on Kaiser speaking. 
KAISER
I… Your mother, Faud. She forgave you. Before she died. She forgave you. For leaving.
Description: Lingering side shot of  Kaiser and Faud. Faud’s gun is still pointed at Kaiser, but his face has gone slack with barely concealed sadness. He has begun to tear up.
NARRATOR
Faud’s jaw tightened even more, and Kaiser watched as his eyes became wet with unshed tears. 
Description: Close up of terrorist’s face as it goes from barely concealed sadness to outright anger. 
LEAD TERRORIST
Quiet, idiot! I’m not Faud. Not anymore.
Description: Close up of Kaiser speaking. He looks concerned and empathetic. 
KAISER
Once you were. She loved you. And she kept loving you even after you decided to not be Faud anymore. 
Description: Kaiser and Faud looking at each other, Faud’s gun lowered slightly, dropping from Kaiser’s face to his chest. Faud looks incredibly depressed and lost. 
NARRATOR
Faud stared at Kaiser, gun lowering slightly, eyes filling up with tears even as the man staunchly refused to blink and shed them. 
LEAD TERRORIST
My mother. What was her name?
KAISER
Miriam.
NARRATOR
For a second, it seemed as if Faud might lower his gun entirely. 
Description: Close up of Faud and Kaiser as Faud puts his gun right on Kaiser’s forehead and gets right up in his face, extremely angry that Kaiser had broken down his defenses for a few seconds. 
NARRATOR
Instead, Kaiser watched as the man’s eyes steeled over and he put the barrel of his gun right up against Kaiser’s forehead. 
LEAD TERRORIST
Who are you?
Description: Close up of Kaiser closing his eyes and taking a deep breath with the barrel of the gun still right on his forehead.
NARRATOR
Kaiser thought about the question for a second. Who was he? Certainly he was different now than he had been not even a half hour before. He could still feel the alien presence pushing against the back of his mind. He didn’t understand it yet, but he knew that the slug in the briefcase had somehow merged with his own mind and given him… something. Who was he? The only answer he had was that he was now somehow more than he had ever been. The presence nudged his mind again, supplying him with the right words.
Description: Kaiser opens his eyes and looks up at where Faud would be if he was in frame. 
KAISER
My name is Kaiser Eziobi. I keep the knowledge of the dead. I know all that is and all that has been. Shoot me, and you kill Life Form 0.
