1. What Is Your Character's Greatest Strength?
(Character's name) identifies primarily as (insert strength), which they perceive as their greatest asset. However, this strength is often accompanied by corresponding shadow weaknesses that they may deny or fear. These weaknesses could include qualities such as ignorance, clumsiness, dispensability, awkwardness, or selfishness.

Example: In Pride & Prejudice, Elizabeth Bennet identifies strongly with her own intelligence and keen perception, but she is blindsided by revelations of her mistaken presumptions about Mr. Darcy, exposing her hypocritical prejudice against him.

2. What Is Your Character's Greatest Weakness?
Although everyone has weaknesses, it is important to consider how these weaknesses can shed light on corresponding strengths that the character has banished to their shadow. The character may be hyper-conscious of certain aspects they perceive as weaknesses, but these weaknesses can hide talents and capabilities within their shadow.

Example: In the movie Nope, OJ's social awkwardness makes him terrible at running his family's business, but it conceals his shadow strength of deep intuitiveness and attention to the natural world, which becomes a superpower when confronted with a space monster.

3. What Is Your Character's Strongest Conviction?
Identify the topic or belief that your character strongly holds onto and would passionately defend without entertaining opposing viewpoints. If the character refuses to consider alternative perspectives, it may indicate a corresponding shadow within them. This conviction can be hypocritical or driven by a sense of shame or guilt.

Example: St. John Rivers in Jane Eyre is a passionately devoted missionary who refuses to acknowledge his own capacity for love. He proposes a loveless marriage to his cousin Jane to avoid any distractions from his holy mission.

4. What Is Your Character's Biggest Fear?
Explore the character's deepest fear, as it often resides within their shadow. Overcoming this fear can lead to personal empowerment. By facing their shadow, characters often discover that what they feared in the real world is less capable of hurting them than they believed.

Example: In the movie Secondhand Lions, Walter's greatest fear is being abandoned by those who profess to love him. However, he finds within himself the courage and loyalty to refuse to betray and abandon his great-uncles.

5. Who or What Is Your Character Most Likely to Vilify?
Identify the person or group your character harbors hatred towards and blames for everything wrong in the world. Consider the generalities or stereotypes represented by this person. Often, the character's vilified traits are shadows within themselves, creating a mirror effect between the protagonist and the antagonist.

Example: In Schindler's List, Oskar fights against the genocidal Nazis, but he himself starts out as a businessman caring only about functionality and profit from his workers.

6. Who or What Is Your Character Most Likely to Revere?
Consider who your character idolizes and aspires to be like. This person represents qualities and strengths that the character may project out of their shadow. Alternatively, the character may admire specific status symbols that reflect positive traits they already possess in a different way.

Example: A character longing to be beautiful and idolizing the school's popularity queen may either devalue their own unique beauty or realize that the traits they value as beautiful are already latent within them.
