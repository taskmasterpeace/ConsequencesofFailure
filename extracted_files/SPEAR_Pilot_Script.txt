INT. RECEPTION AREA - DAY



A large, modern room with a high ceiling. The walls are painted white and there are several windows that let in natural light. There is a long reception desk with a few chairs and couches scattered around. A few people are milling about, talking on their phones or typing on laptops.



KATHRYN RAILLY, a 28-year-old woman dressed in a sober business suit, is sitting in one of the chairs, reading a book. Her phone suddenly BEEPS, BEEP! BEEP!



She looks at it with a start, then gets up and hurries towards the exit.



CUT TO:



INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY



Kathryn is sitting at the bedside of a middle-aged man, JAMES COLE. He is hooked up to a bunch of machines and looks very weak.



KATHRYN:
Hey, Jim. How are you feeling today?



JAMES:
(weakly)
I'm alright, I guess. Just a little tired.



KATHRYN:
Well, you need your rest. The doctors say you're making progress.



JAMES:
(sighs)
I just wish I could remember what happened to me.



KATHRYN:
(gently)
Don't worry, Jim. We'll figure it out. I promise.



JAMES:
(smiles weakly)
Thanks, Kathryn.



Kathryn gives his hand a squeeze, then gets up to leave the room.



CUT TO:



INT. POLICE STATION - DAY



Kathryn is sitting across from DETECTIVE MARK HILL, a gruff, middle-aged man. He's looking through a file folder.



DETECTIVE HILL:
So, you say this guy just showed up at your office with no memory of how he got there?



KATHRYN:
That's right. He was barely even conscious. We had to call an ambulance.



DETECTIVE HILL:
And you have no idea who he is?



KATHRYN:
No. I've never seen him before in my life.



DETECTIVE HILL:
Well, we'll run his fingerprints and see if we can't find out who he is. In the meantime, you should probably get a restraining order. Just to be safe.



KATHRYN:
(nods)
Yeah. I'll do that. Thanks, Detective.



DETECTIVE HILL:
No problem. We'll be in touch.



Kathryn gets up and leaves the detective's office. As she walks down the hall, she looks worried.



CUT TO:



INT. KATHRYN'S OFFICE - DAY



Kathryn is on the phone, pacing back and forth.



KATHRYN:
Yes, I understand. But this is a very sensitive situation. I just need a little more time.



She listens for a moment, then sighs.



KATHRYN:
Fine. I'll be there in an hour.



She hangs up the phone, then sits down at her desk and puts her head in her hands.



CUT TO:



EXT. PARK - DAY



Kathryn is sitting on a bench, reading a book. Suddenly, she feels someone watching her and looks up. James is standing a few feet away, looking at her.



KATHRYN:
(stands up, alarmed)
Hey! What are you doing here?



JAMES:
(nervous)
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I just wanted to talk to you.



KATHRYN:
(backing away)
How did you find me?



JAMES:
(shrugs)
I don't know. I just kind of... felt like you would be here.



KATHRYN:
(suspicious)
Look, James. I've been thinking about what you said and I'm not sure it's a good idea for us to be talking.



JAMES:
(pleads)
Please, Kathryn. I'm just so lost. I don't know what to do. I need your help.



KATHRYN:
(hesitates)
Okay. But we need to be careful, alright? We don't want to attract any attention.



JAMES:
(nods)
I understand.



KATHRYN:
(sits down on the bench)
So, what do you want to talk about?



JAMES:
(sits down next to her)
I don't know. I just feel like there's something I'm supposed to remember. But I can't. It's like there's a wall in my head that I can't get past.



KATHRYN:
(sympathetic)
I'm sure the doctors will be able to help you with that. In the meantime, maybe it would be best if you just tried to focus on the here and now.



JAMES:
(sighs)
I guess you're right. It's just so frustrating. I feel like I'm missing something important.



KATHRYN:
(reassuring)
Don't worry, James. We'll figure it out. I promise.



JAMES:
(smiles)
Thanks, Kathryn.



Kathryn and James sit in silence for a moment, then they both stand up and start to walk away.



FADE TO BLACK.



INT. KATHRYN'S OFFICE - DAY



Kathryn is sitting at her desk, going through some papers. Her phone rings and she answers it.



KATHRYN:
Hello?



DETECTIVE HILL:
(on the phone)
Ms. Reed? This is Detective Hill. We've got some information on your friend.



KATHRYN:
(sits up straight, alert)
Really? What is it?



DETECTIVE HILL:
(on the phone)
Well, his fingerprints came back clean. No criminal record. But we did find out who he is.



KATHRYN:
(eager)
Who is he?



DETECTIVE HILL:
(on the phone)
His name is James Foster. He's a scientist with the government.



KATHRYN:
(surprised)
A scientist? What kind of scientist?



DETECTIVE HILL:
(on the phone)
He works for a classified government organization called SPEAR.



KATHRYN:
(intrigued)
What is SPEAR?



DETECTIVE HILL:
(on the phone)
I'm sorry, ma'am. That's classified information. I can't tell you anymore.



KATHRYN:
(disappointed)
I see. Well, thank you for your help, Detective.



DETECTIVE HILL:
(on the phone)
You're welcome. We'll be in touch if we find out anything else.



Kathryn hangs up the phone and leans back in her chair, deep in thought.



CUT TO:



INT. KATHRYN'S HOUSE - NIGHT



Kathryn is sitting on her couch, reading a book. There is a knock at the door and she gets up to answer it. James is standing there.



KATHRYN:
(surprised)
James! What are you doing here?



JAMES:
(nervous)
I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't be here. But I just had to see you.



KATHRYN:
(suspicious)
How did you find out where I live?



JAMES:
(shrugs)
I looked up your address.



KATHRYN:
(alarmed)
You what? James, you can't just go around looking up people's addresses. That's not safe.



JAMES:
(apologetic)
I know. I'm sorry. I just... I don't know what else to do. I feel like I'm losing my mind.



KATHRYN:
(sympathetic)
Come in, James. There's no need to stand out there in the cold.



James comes inside and Kathryn closes the door behind him.



KATHRYN:
(continues)
I've been doing some research and I think I might have an idea of what's going on with you.



JAMES:
(eager)
Really? What is it?



KATHRYN:
(picks up a book from her coffee table)
Have you ever heard of SPEAR?



James's eyes widen in recognition.



JAMES:
(voice trembling)
Yes... I think so. But I can't remember why.



KATHRYN:
(explains)
SPEAR is a government organization. They're involved in classified research, mostly to do with extraterrestrial life.



JAMES:



(incredulous)
Extraterrestrial life? You're kidding, right?



KATHRYN:
(shakes her head)
I'm afraid not. I think you might have been working for them.



JAMES:
(starts to pace)
That can't be right. I would remember something like that.



KATHRYN:
(reaches out to touch his arm)
James, calm down. We don't know for sure yet. Let's just take things one step at a time, okay?



JAMES:
(nods)
Okay. You're right. I'm sorry. I just... I feel like my whole life has been turned upside down.



KATHRYN:
(understanding)
I know how you feel. But we'll figure this out. I promise.



FADE TO BLACK.



INT. KATHRYN'S HOUSE - NIGHT



Kathryn and James are sitting on the couch, going through some files. James is looking increasingly agitated.



JAMES:
(points to a file)
That's it! That's where I remember seeing the name SPEAR before.



KATHRYN:
(looks at the file)
This is your personnel file from when you worked for them.



JAMES:
(opens the file and starts flipping through it)
Yes, but what does it say? I can't make sense of any of this.



KATHRYN:
(takes the file from him)
Let me see.



Kathryn starts to read through the file. After a moment, she looks up at James, her expression serious.



KATHRYN:
(quietly)
James... I'm not sure you're going to like what you hear.



JAMES:
(nervous)
What is it? What does it say?



Kathryn takes a deep breath before beginning.



KATHRYN:
(continues)
It says that you were recruited by SPEAR because of your expertise in astrophysics. They were interested in your research on black holes.



JAMES:
(interrupting)
Wait, so I was working for them? Why can't I remember any of this?



KATHRYN:
(ignores his question)
But then something happened. They don't say what, exactly. Only that you were involved in an... incident. After that, you were discharged from the organization.



JAMES:
(voice trembling)
An incident? What kind of incident?



Kathryn shake her head.



KATHRYN:
(continues)
I don't know. But whatever it was, it must have been pretty serious. They wiped all records of you from their database. Even your name is blacked out.



JAMES:
(stands up, pacing)
This is crazy. I can't believe any of this is true.



KATHRYN:
(reaches out to him)
Try to remember, James. What was the last thing you remember before you started losing your memories?



JAMES:
(stops pacing, thinking)



I... I don't know. It's all just a blur.



KATHRYN:
(gently)
It's okay. Just take your time.



Suddenly, James remembers something. His eyes widen in realization.



JAMES:
(quietly)
King Stefanos...



KATHRYN:
(confused)
What? The President of Greece?
