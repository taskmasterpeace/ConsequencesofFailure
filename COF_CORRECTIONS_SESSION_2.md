# COF CORRECTIONS - Session 2 (November 18, 2025)

## CRITICAL CORRECTION: THE TWO TIME TRAVELERS

### WRONG ASSUMPTION (Session 1):
- Thought Liu Xiao was the 2nd time traveler

### CORRECT INFORMATION:

**The ONLY 2 Time Travelers:**
1. **Asha (India)** - Travels to the FUTURE
2. **Unnamed Chinese Team Member** - Travels to the PAST

**Liu Xiao is NOT a time traveler!**

## CHINA TEAM DYNAMICS

### Liu Xiao's Actual Power:
- **Can give people powers using Mule Spheres**
- This is his main ability
- Strategic importance for China

### The Chinese Time Traveler (Unnamed):
**Relationship to Liu Xiao:**
- Part of China's team
- **Can travel into Liu Xiao's personal past**
- Observes Liu Xiao's history
- Learns things about him

**What He Discovers - THE PATTERN:**
- **"The further back he goes into the past, the more loyal Liu Xiao is to the government"**
- This is a pattern he notices over time
- Important character revelation
- "Some dope shit that he says" once they get to know each other

**Initial Dynamics:**
- Chinese time traveler is **suspicious of Liu Xiao** at first
- Because Liu Xiao can give people powers (dangerous ability)
- Trust has to be built over time

## ASHA'S POWERS - DETAILED

### How Future Travel Works:

**Ghost-Like State:**
- When she travels to the future, she's **almost like a ghost**
- Tries to make sure people ignore her
- **Anything she touches, she can bring back**
- **Anytime she interacts** (with people/objects), she can retrieve it

**Psychological Cost:**
- Being a "ghost" in the future **slowly eats at her**
- **Slowly drives her a little crazy**
- Her sanity/wit deteriorates over time from this
- Important character arc - the power has a price

**Year 8:** Alliance of Four arrives
