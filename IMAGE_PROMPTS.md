## STYLE NOTES FOR ALL IMAGES:

**Photorealism** with elements of:
- Cinematic lighting (golden hour preferred)
- Documentary photography when depicting "real" moments
- Subtle supernatural/sci-fi elements (don't overpower realism)
- Emotional weight in expressions
- Scale (show the epic scope)
- Diverse representation (authentic to characters' origins)

**Color Palette:**
- Earth tones grounded in reality
- Alien tech: cool metallics, bioluminescent blues/purples
- Golden hour lighting for hope/beauty
- Harsh fluorescents for government/facility scenes
- Neon for urban decay/crime scenes

**Avoid:**
- Marvel/DC comic book aesthetics (too bright, too clean)
- Anime style (wrong tone)
- Generic stock photo look
- Overly CGI feel (keep it grounded)

**Reference Mood:**
- Denis Villeneuve films (Arrival, Blade Runner 2049)
- Michael Crichton adaptations (Jurassic Park realism)
- The Expanse (grounded sci-fi)
- District 9 (gritty alien realism)
