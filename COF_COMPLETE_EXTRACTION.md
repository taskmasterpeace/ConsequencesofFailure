"I've always been a fan of Rain. His lyrics have always been about equality, about justice. Maybe he just might be the change we need."

"Johnny's music, his messages... there's a truth to them, I cannot deny. I just hope that, if he does step into power, these truths wouldn't ebb away."

- "These gates serve not just as an entry or exit point to our esteemed institution, but also as a reminder. A reminder that exploration has limits."
- **RULE: NEVER leave school after sundown**

**Mosses' Reaction:**
- Deep breath
- Desperately trying to keep fears at bay
- Dire possibilities striking grim chord with everyone

**Mr. Okello's Softer Tone:**
"You are in Kampala but this school is our home. And you have all come here to learn and grow, to build a brighter future for yourselves and your families. This school will provide you with the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed, but it is up to each of you to put in the hard work and dedication required. Follow the rules, respect your peers and instructors, and never forget the reason you are here. It is crucial that you remain vigilant and aware of your surroundings at all times. If you see anything suspicious or out of the ordinary, report it immediately to a member of staff."

**Sam's Question:**
"Sir, what about our families and friends who live in the city? How can we ensure their safety as well?"

**Mr. Okello's Response:**
"Sam, we cannot control everything that happens outside these walls. All of you are welcome to go home when you want, but once you leave, you cannot return. There are many others who want your position in this school."

**Student Question:**
"Mr. Okello, what should we do if we find ourselves in a dangerous situation outside of school grounds?"

**Mr. Okello's Advice:**
"First, try to remove yourself from the situation as quickly and safely as possible. Find a trusted adult or authority figure, such as a police officer, who can assist you. But remember, prevention is key. Avoid taking unnecessary risks, and always stay within the designated areas when you leave the school premises."

**Final Words:**
"You are not just students; you are part of the Kampala Driving & Mechanics School family, and we must work together to ensure that everyone stays safe."

**Aftermath:**
- Students filed out
- Thoughts heavy with implications
- Mosses, Ali, and Sam walked together in silence
- Each lost in own thoughts

**Ali's Light Comment:**
"Wish these worried faces were due to a tough car engine problem."
- Attempt at humor fell flat
- Eased tense atmosphere a bit

**Mosses:**
- Yawned, rubbed eyes (red from exhaustion)
- "I think it's time I try to get some sleep. Class tomorrow."

### MOSSES' NIGHTMARE & SAM'S PROPOSAL

**The Nightmare:**
- Mosses jolted awake
- Deafening voices from outside window
- Heart stopped cold
- Peeked through curtains
- Menacing B13 gang members
- Weapons gleaming in moonlight
- Shouting threats at one another
- Frenzied panic
- Scrambled to shut and lock window
- Plunged room into darkness
- Held breath, praying not seen
- Curled up beneath bed
- Eyes glued on locked door

**Waking from Nightmare:**
- Harsh laughter and crude shouts dissolved
- Foggy nothingness replaced violent images
- Like mute button hit on monstrous television
- Sweating and shuddering
- Gasped - realized nightmare
- Heart raced

**Sam's Appearance:**
- Stoic silhouette appears
- "Mosses, it was a nightmare. You're safe."

**Mosses:** "Why are you here, Sam?"

**The Discovery:**
- Sam unlocks phone
- Photo: Johnny Rain with man from earlier attack
- Caption: "Tour life alongside my trustworthy campaign manager"
- Man they saw beaten is tied to Rain - CAMPAIGN MANAGER

**Second Photo:**
- Close-up of same man
- Wearing intricately designed ring
- Same ring that rolled under fish cart during fight

**Sam's Proposal:**
"Remember the street scuffle when a ring came loose from our man's hand and rolled away underneath the nearby fish cart? That's it! Consider this. Johnny Rain's clout and financial backing could make that ring's reward lucrative. Enough, perhaps, to purchase the whole of our school, if wishes had wings. Mosses, you in for a city ride? A ring retrieval mission with me?"

**Mosses:** "What about Ali? Is he in on it?"

**Sam's Manipulation:**
"No, I had to get you onboard first. You see, Ali's a diehard fan of Rain. Get him involved, and he'll most likely keep the ring as a trophy. But you, you seemed indifferent. May even have some lean towards the current government."

**Mosses:** "Me, Pro Government?!"

**Sam:** "I'm just working off our conversation earlier. You seem mesmerized by President Mugisha, ever since that handshake. Don't you think that treads dangerously close to propagandist territory? Or is it outright annoyance towards Johnny Rain?"

**Mosses:** "What! Sam, that's not fair."

**Sam's Challenge:**
"Well, prove me wrong, Mosses. Prove that you can set aside your love for the President, and help me get Johnny Rain's friend, his ring back."

**Mosses' Response:**
"No, Sam, I came here to learn mechanics and I am going back to sleep. Goodnight."

### EPISODE 3: "BETRAYAL"

**Workshop Scene:**

- Students in grease-stained uniforms
- Countless hours of hard work evident

**Mosses at Work:**
- Carefully prying open carburetor
- Brow furrowed in concentration
- Marvels at how far he's come
- Complex machinery now familiar puzzle

**Ali at Work:**
- Adjacent table
- Elbows-deep in engine block
- Expression: determination and frustration

**Workshop feels off-kilter without Sam**

**Mosses:**
"Apwoyo matek" (Thank you very much - self-encouragement)
- Wiping sweat from brow

**Calling to Ali:**
"Ali, have you seen Sam today? He's never late like this."

**Sam's Dramatic Entrance:**
- Bursts into workshop
- Eyes wide
- "Moses, you won't believe what I found last night! It's the ring I told you about from the fight!"
- Thrusts hand forward
- Glinting ring revealed

**Ali:** "What?" (puzzled, cautious voice)

**Sam's Revelation:**
"Ali, yesterday when we were walking downtown Kampala and saw the Jonny Rain fan get beaten up by those B13 gangsters, I noticed a ring roll under the fish market stand. But that isn't the most interesting part. I heard something huge."

**The Conspiracy:**
- Sam heard conversation between:
  - Sharply dressed man with expensive wooden glasses
  - Cato, notorious B13 gang leader
- Discussing sabotage
- Couldn't make out all details
- Sounded like: all power in Kampala would go out during Johnny Rain broadcast

**Mosses:** "Are you sure it was Cato?" (heart pounding)

**Sam:** "Positive. They were discussing some sort of sabotage."

**Ali's Reaction:**
- Eyes darted around nervously
- "We need to tell Mr. Okello"
- Voice firm
- Immediately went to office
- Shared conspiracy theory with instructor

**Sam to Mosses:**
"You should have come with me last night Mosses, can you imagine if the President were to get away with such a thing?"

**Mosses' Skepticism:**
- Shook head, chuckling
- "You're just saying this because you've always been a fan of Johnny Rain"
- Casts skeptical glance

**Sam's Insistence:**
"Ah, Moses, I'm serious! Look at this Moses. Do you understand the size of what's happening? It's not just about this ring but what it represents. Jonny Rain is not just another politician. He wants real changes for Uganda, and these people, they want to stop that at all costs. They are going to plunge our city into darkness!"

**Ali Returns:**
- Message from Mr. Okello
- Wants to speak to all three

---

### MEETING WITH MR. OKELLO

**Mr. Okello's Office:**

- Occasional motivational poster

**Mosses' Anxiety:**
- Hands grow clammy
- First encounter with situation larger than preferred
- Mr. Okello commands respect and fear

**Mr. Okello:** "Watye ki?" (What's up? - familiar baritone)

**Sam's Full Story:**
- Spills out tale completely
- Mentions Cato - Mr. Okello raises eyebrow
- Remains silent after Sam finishes
- Takes moment to gather thoughts

**Mr. Okello's Response:**
"Sam, true or not, matters of politics and the city's troubles aren't to be toyed with. But most of all they are not this school's worries."

**Mosses:** Relief at hearing Mr. Okello echo his sentiment

**Ali's Concern:**
"But sir, if Sam's story is true, couldn't it affect us all?"

**Mr. Okello:**
- Looks thoughtful
- "You boys are here to learn a trade and improve your futures. Everything else is a distraction."

**After Meeting:**

**Sam:** "History is penned by those brave enough to chase it, Moses. True or not, shouldn't we at least try to find Johnny Rain and warn him? If this is true, we could stop a potentially dangerous event."

**Moses:** "Mr. Okello is right, Sam. We are here to learn, not to get entangled in these dangerous plots."

**Sam to Ali:**
"It feels lately like the President is controlling our instructor and our friend." (glancing back at Mosses)

---

### THE INTERVIEW & BLACKOUT

**Workshop Atmosphere:**
- Another busy day

- Normally fun banter replaced with serious, whispered conversations

**Mr. Okello's Announcement:**
- Tuning into Johnny Rain's much-anticipated interview
- Moses concentrated on carburetor
- Stole concerned glances at Sam
- Sam more reserved and quiet than usual

**Student Whispers:**
"I still can't believe Sam thinks they would sabotage the interview."

**The Interview:**
- Echoed from old radio in corner
- Broadcaster's voice brimming with excitement

- Discomfort prickled
- Thoughts spiraling back to Sam's warning

**The Radio Failure:**

- Not just Sam's wild theory anymore

**Ali's Voice:** "Sam. You were right... we all thought... but... you were right."

**Ali's Phone:**
- Lights up in darkness
- Under room's glares
- "I need to let Mr. Okello know."

**Aftermath:**
- Eerie silence while Ali relayed information
- Once energetic workshop caught in storm of suspicion and fear

**Sam:** "Imagine the chaos if the press gets this."

**Moses:**

- Like storm clouds he'd ignored all day

---

### SAM'S DISAPPEARANCE

**The Next Day:**
- Sam running away from school
- Feet barely touching ground
- Eyes wide and frightened
- Shot glance at Moses and Ali before turning away
- "My mum's really sick"
- Stammered as he ran
- Sun just begun to dip below horizon
- Sky like oil painting
- All they felt was dread

**Days Later:**

**Ali:** "Things have changed without Sam around. Remember our agreement? We said we'd stick together no matter what."

**Moses:** "Enkya. I'll talk to Mr. Okello. Maybe he knows something we don't."

**The Shocking Discovery:**
- Moses walked through corridors with determination
- Approached Mr. Okello's office
- Paused, took deep breath
- Knocked
- "Yiya" - Mr. Okello's voice called
- Moses entered
- STOPPED SHORT
- Inside: Man matching Sam's description
- Man with expensive wooden glasses
- Chill ran down Moses' spine
- Hastily retreated

**Moses to Ali:**
"Ali! I saw the man! With the wooden glasses in Mr. Okello's office!"

**Ali:** "Are you sure?"

**Moses:** "I am certain. Maybe you should call Sam."

**Ali's Call to Sam:**
- Hesitated
- Glanced at Moses with worry etched on face
- Nodded
- Dialed Sam's number
- Mind raced with questions:
  - What did this man want with their school?
  - Did Mr. Okello know him?

**Phone Conversation:**

**Sam:** (distant and guarded) "Hello?"

**Ali:** (voice shaking) "Sam, it's me. Moses saw him - the man with the wooden glasses."

**Sam:** (stern tone) "Listen. Don't call me again."

**Ali:** "Alright."

**After Call:**
- Ali looked at Moses expectantly
- Eyes full of worry
- Ali hesitated
- Decided to share Sam's warning
- "Sam told us to stay away from the man and focus on our studies. He'll handle it."

**Moses:** "Let's hope so." (unconvinced)

**Both returned to work**

---

### THE INTERROGATION & ALI'S ARREST

**Workshop Atmosphere:**
- Sun cast warm glow over school
- Atmosphere NOT comforting
- Whispers and rumors spread like wildfire
- Moses couldn't shake constant unease
- Working on brake exam

**Student Whispers:**
"Did you hear? They say those three knew about the plot and didn't do anything."
"Bringing politics into our school. I thought we were here to learn, not to get involved in dangerous games."

**Moses' Reaction:**
- Clenched jaw
- Tried to focus on mechanical components
- Heard whispers countless times over past few days
- Each one chipping away at resolve
- Weight of rumors bore down
- Suffocating with insidious implications

**Moses to Ali:**
"Ali, it's getting worse. We've got to act."

**Ali:** "Like what? We don't even know what's going on. And besides, Sam told us to stay out of it."

**Moses:** "Maybe that was a mistake. Maybe we should have warned Johnny Rain."

**Ali:** "Or maybe we would have just made things worse. We can't change the past, Moses. All we can do is stick together and try to make it through this."

**Mr. Ssenyonjo's Entrance:**
- Footsteps approaching
- Jolt of adrenaline through Moses
- Looked up
- Well-dressed man with expensive wooden glasses
- Strolling confidently across workshop floor

**Mr. Ssenyonjo:**
"Hello, boys, my apologies. This will only be a brief interruption for twelve of you. I am looking for Ali Bahri. I'm here to ask you a few questions about the recent power outage in Kampala."

**Ali:** (expression hardening, standing protectively in front of Moses) "Who are you?"

**Mr. Ssenyonjo:**
"Ah, my apologies. My name is Mr. Ssenyonjo, and I was commissioned by the President to investigate whether any... malicious intent was behind the blackout during Johnny Rain's interview."

**Moses:** (heart pounding) "Wh-what does that have to do with us?"

**Mr. Ssenyonjo:**
"Your friend Sam seemed quite interested in the matter. I was hoping you might be able to shed some light on his... concerns."

**Ali:**
- Swallowed hard
- Hands clenched into fists
- Glanced at Moses
- Fear flickering behind eyes
- When spoke, voice calm and steady
- "Sam isn't here right now. And we don't know anything about the power outage. We're just trying to focus on our studies."

**Mr. Ssenyonjo's Speech:**
"Of course. My father used to say that an education was the gateway to success. He would speak of school life as if it were a lifeline in a sea of societal chaos."
- Voice serenely low
- Oasis-like contradiction to Moses' rising distress
- Adjusted wooden glasses
- Polished presence throwing odd reflections

**The Evidence:**
- Casually produced folded paper from pocket
- "Oh, speaking of lifelines..."
- Slowly unfolding paper
- "It seems that a call was made from a mobile phone. A call from a mobile which seems to have slipped through the cracks of this school's records. The call was made to your friend Sam, amongst the time I was here a few days ago."
- Paused, letting implication sink in
- Hushed whispers fell into deep silence

**The Request:**
"May I see your cell phone, young man?"

**Ali's Response:**
- Visibly trembling
- Turned to Moses
- Silent plea for support

**Moses' Failure:**
- Torn by guilt
- Growing seeds of disdain for situation
- Could only return helpless gaze
- Turned attention to book in front of him
- ONLY student who started to continue brake exercise
- Left Ali alone

**The Arrest:**

- Satisfied grin increased suffocating tension
- Matched phone number on folder paper to Ali's phone
- Ali promptly ARRESTED
- Dreams of escaping societal turmoil through education VAPORIZED
- Under harsh gaze of Mr. Ssenyonjo

**Aftermath:**

- Moses alone with guilt and fear
- Only sound: ceaseless tick of classroom clock
- And Mosses working on braking exercises

### MOSSES' GUILT & LAKE VICTORIA

**In Dorm Room:**
- Sat on edge of bed
- Staring blankly at wall
- Couldn't shake feeling of guilt
- Knew he played part in Ali's arrest
- Too afraid to speak up
- Too afraid to confront man in workshop
- Ali paying price for his cowardice

**The Whispers:**
- Dorm room quiet and empty
- Could still hear whispers of other students echoing
- Felt his legs taking him
- Almost guided by unseen force
- Out of dormitory towards lake

**Lake Victoria:**
- Never seen it before
- Today needed something more than silence
- Wanted peace
- Peace he felt back home
- Lake as large as ocean
- There would be peace there

**Sleepless Night:**

- Guilt became his mistress
- Inky shadows cast by flickering bulb
- Morphed into monstrous whispers of fear and regret

- Ali sitting in prison
- Suddenly longed for silence call of nature
- Looked at map
- Decided short trip to Lake Victoria to clear mind

**Journey to Lake:**
- Leaving dread-filled dormitory
- Anticipating calm, welcoming shores
- Early morning
- Journey usually felt like adventure
- Now felt like funeral procession
- Stillness hung in air
- Distant sound of lake's gentle lapping amplified
- Approaching
- Typically lively lakeside unnaturally hushed
- No morning birds or frogs
- As if nature sharing in mournful meditation for Ali

**At the Shore:**
- Couldn't help remember mother's words
- "Be kind to others, work hard, and never forget where you come from"
- Wondered if he'd forgotten in face of city's chaos

**The Lake:**
- Water usually shimmered and danced under morning sun
- Lay unusually still
- As if holding breath
- Usual twinkling eyes dull and apprehensive
- Tranquil atmosphere stark contrast to storm within Moses
- Adding layer of estrangement
- Environment supposed to be solace

**Final Moments:**
- Examined serene landscape one last time
- Slid onto dew-draped grass by water's edge
- Cool kiss of grass blades
- Momentary relief from inner turmoil
- Silhouetting against breaking dawn
- Rippling mirages of orange and purples
- Felt strange humming vibration coursing through him

**The Eerie Hum:**
- Pulsating in unison with throbbing heartbeat
- Seemed to echo from depths of lake
- Rise and fall lulled into trance-like state
- World around receding into blur
- Tried to decipher enigmatic hum
- Elusive, slipping through understanding

**The Abduction:**
- Without warning
- Invisible force gripped him from trance
- Startled
- No time to react
- World evaporated into maelstrom of sheer white
- Yanked off feet
- Thrust headlong into heart of mysterious energy

**The Vortex:**
- Where serene lakeside had been
- Silent vortex exploded into life
- Multi-hued whirlwind of colors and shapes
- Spiraled around him
- Grass beneath exchanged for abyss of uncertainty
- Laws of reality distorted and contorted
- Vortex pulled into imploding chaos
- Time and space lost meaning
- Spiraled down vortex
- Violent, kaleidoscopic journey through unknown
- Scream lost in tumultuous whirl of energy
- Devoured whole

**The Silence:**
- As quickly as arrived
- Chaotic vortex GONE
- Edge of Lake Victoria EMPTY
- Moses Apio: VANISHED

**DESCRIPTION:** Kaiser kneeling at foot of bed, hunched over with hands clasped on footboard, eyes closed, room still dark, sun beginning to rise slightly more

**NARRATOR:**
"Taking a deep breath, he turned around and knelt at the foot of his bed. Even though he had stopped believing in anything many years ago, Kaiser still attempted prayer every day. His mouth muttered the words to the prayers he'd said since childhood, but he knew he wasn't actually praying. Maybe he had been before, before everything had happened. Not now. Instead, his mind replayed his last meeting with Justus, as it had every day since it happened."

**DESCRIPTION:** Same mid shot, Kaiser writing with pen on notepad

**Notepad reads:**
- "To-Do List"
- "1. Change name of J&K helicopters"

**NARRATOR:**
"J&K Helicopters had just one flight scheduled that day, slated for 10 am to Borno state. J&K. Yet another thing he needed to take care of. There was no J anymore. He reached for his notepad and scribbled out a to-do list. '1. Change name of J&K helicopters.'"

**DESCRIPTION:** Same mid shot, Kaiser holding flight sheet, hand rests on desk, not looking at it, distracted by computer off to side, looking at email, hand on keyboard ready to type response

**NARRATOR:**
"He went back to the only flight for that day - some Korean diplomat and his wife - when his computer pinged. He opened the message to see that their pilot had called in ill, and they needed a replacement. It'd been a while since he'd actually piloted his helicopters, and he felt a small thrill rush down his spine at the thought, so he messaged back that he would handle the flight himself."

### THE PASSENGERS ARRIVE

**DESCRIPTION:** Kaiser stands in hangar with helicopter. At open end, Rolls Royce Phantom pulling up, kicking up dust. Car has well-dressed Korean couple in back and chauffeur in front. Kaiser bent over checking helicopter engine with checklist on clipboard, but head turned to look at car

**NARRATOR:**
"Kaiser waited for his passengers by the hanger, making a quick survey of the helicopter. He'd just finished checking out the engine when the passengers arrived, ferried in a Rolls Royce Phantom. He frowned at the thought of a Rolls Royce Phantom on Nigerian roads."

**DESCRIPTION:** Mid shot of Korean couple

**Korean Diplomat (Husband):**
- Middle aged man in tan suit
- Carries shiny metal briefcase
- Camera hanging around neck

**Korean Wife:**
- Woman in her twenties
- Tight, glamorous dress
- Heels
- Carrying purse

**NARRATOR:**
"The Korean diplomat and his wife approached the plane. The man carried a shiny briefcase, and a camera hung around his neck. Yet another thing you shouldn't do in Nigeria, Kaiser thought. The couple was going to Damboa, located in Borno State, which was a hotbed for Akrahuhum, the Islamic terrorist group. It was hardly the place to take photographs, but it wasn't his place to tell them that. He wondered for a split second what could be in the briefcase. No one traveled to Borno for the tourist spots."

---

### THE FLIGHT

**DESCRIPTION:** Wide side shot of red helicopter. Kaiser in front wearing headset with hands on controls. Korean couple in back turned towards each other like speaking to each other, not to Kaiser

**NARRATOR:**
"The plan was to land on the outskirts of Damboa, drop off the passengers and wait for no more than a half hour until they returned, then take off almost immediately. In and out. Neither the diplomat nor his wife spoke to Kaiser the entire way, only speaking to each other in their own language, but that was fine by him."

**DESCRIPTION:** Helicopter after touching down in sandy, deserted area with single dirt road. Husband helping wife descend from back. Kaiser still seated in front, flipping switches, preparing to take off again

**NARRATOR:**
"After a few hours, they touched down in Damboa. The couple disembarked and walked a ways down the dirt road he had landed them by, just out of earshot of the helicopter."

---

### THE TERRORISTS ARRIVE

**DESCRIPTION:** Three camo jeeps at middle distance driving along dirt road towards where two Korean diplomats stand. Korean man holds shiny silver briefcase. Jeeps kicking up lots of dust. Men dressed in camo and black with hair and face coverings driving, sitting in, hanging off jeep frames. Each man has automatic rifle strapped to back

**NARRATOR:**
"After a few minutes, several camo jeeps came driving down the road, kicking up dust. Kaiser tensed up as he saw who the jeeps carried - at least a dozen men all dressed in black and camo, head and mouths covered, with automatic rifles strapped to their backs. The symbol on their armbands was barely legible from that distance, but Kaiser knew who they were: Akrahuhum."

**DESCRIPTION:** Five or six terrorists walk in loose V formation towards Korean diplomats. One in lead holds black briefcase. Rest remain in jeeps. Second shot: close up on black locked briefcase set on ground

**NARRATOR:**
"Kaiser watched as they jumped out of the jeeps and approached the diplomats. One of the terrorists took point, carrying another large briefcase which he set on the ground in front of him once he'd approached."

---

### THE NEGOTIATION

**DESCRIPTION:** Shot of diplomats and terrorists negotiating from Kaiser's perspective. Koreans and terrorists clearly arguing. Terrorists behind lead have drawn weapons

**NARRATOR:**
"Kaiser fixed his eyes on the interaction intently. The Korean diplomats seemed upset at something, gesturing to the suitcase on the ground and back to their own repeatedly. The terrorists were also getting increasingly agitated, and it escalated to the point where Kaiser could hear them yelling from where he sat. His grip tightened on the throttle."

**DESCRIPTION:** Same shot but Koreans have opened briefcase to show terrorists contents. Two parties no longer appear agitated. Second close shot of Korean briefcase exchanging hands between male diplomat and lead terrorist

**NARRATOR:**
"Then, something seemed to shift in the interaction, and he relaxed slightly. The Koreans had opened their suitcase, but Kaiser couldn't see what was inside - cash, presumably. The lead terrorist nodded and took the Korean's briefcase as the Korean woman went and took the terrorists'."

**DESCRIPTION:** Shot from Kaiser's perspective of two Korean diplomats walking back up dirt road away from terrorists with black briefcase. Terrorists made no moves to get back in jeeps

**NARRATOR:**
"The two diplomats began to make their way back to the helicopter, black briefcase in hand. Kaiser began flipping switches to prepare for take off. He didn't want to stay there any longer than necessary."

---

### THE AMBUSH

**DESCRIPTION:** Mid close up on several terrorists firing semi-automatics

**NARRATOR:**
"Just as the diplomats were a little more than halfway to the helicopter, a cry rang out, and the Akrahuhum suddenly opened fire. Bullets shot through the air in volleys."

**DESCRIPTION:** Close up of Kaiser looking panicked and flipping switches in helicopter cockpit to ready for take off

**NARRATOR:**
"The two diplomats began to sprint towards Kaiser, who wildly began firing up the engine and preparing for takeoff as fast as he could."

**DESCRIPTION:** Action shot of male Korean diplomat getting riddled with bullets from behind. Blood soaked white button down in several places. Looks about to fall forward and faceplant on ground

**NARRATOR:**
"A bullet clipped the male diplomat in the shoulder, and then two more ripped through his stomach and he fell to the ground face first, dead. The woman, who still had the black briefcase, kept running. The terrorists kept firing, apparently after whatever was in the briefcase as well as the money they'd received in exchange for it."

---

### ESCAPE ATTEMPT

**DESCRIPTION:** Shot of whole helicopter. Kaiser looks back as female diplomat climbs into helicopter while holding black briefcase. Helicopter's blades spinning as if to take off very quickly

**NARRATOR:**
"Miraculously, the woman reached the helicopter and heaved herself and the briefcase in. Kaiser was ready for takeoff, blades already spinning to lift them in the air, and they began their ascent. But, the terrorists had other ideas."

**DESCRIPTION:** Aerial shot of terrorists and jeeps, as if from helicopter. One jeep has been turned around to reveal rocket launcher in back, which terrorists around it are preparing to fire

**NARRATOR:**
"One of the jeeps pulled around, revealing a rocket launcher strapped to the back of it. The Korean woman yelled at him in a language he couldn't understand, probably urging him to go faster."

**DESCRIPTION:** Very scared looking Kaiser in helicopter attempting to push throttle all the way to left to avoid rocket launcher. Korean diplomat in back looking scared and yelling at him. Second shot of nose of rocket during flight path

**NARRATOR:**
"Kaiser's eyes widened and he tried to jerk the helicopter out of the way, but it was too late. The rocket hurtled towards them, aimed straight at the helicopter's engine in the back. This was it. His last moments."

---

### THE CRASH

**DESCRIPTION:** Outside shot of rocket impacting helicopter. Flames engulf back half of helicopter, including where Korean diplomat sits. Kaiser still desperately trying to maneuver helicopter

**NARRATOR:**
"The rocket hit the helicopter dead on, exploding on impact and catching the entire back half of it on fire. The Korean diplomat's screams turned into wails as the flames began to consume her, but Kaiser didn't turn around, fingers locked around the throttle as he desperately tried to maneuver the helicopter as it spiraled out of control towards the ground."

**DESCRIPTION:** Action shot of Kaiser in foreground hitting ground after being thrown from helicopter. Helicopter smashing into ground behind him, still aflame

**NARRATOR:**
"There was absolutely no way he could avoid a crash, and the helicopter smashed into the ground like a brick. The force of the impact threw Kaiser out of the cockpit, and he landed hard on the sand, knocking the breath out of him and cracking several of his ribs, if the sharp pains in his chest were anything to judge by."

**DESCRIPTION:** Action shot of foreground Kaiser trying to crawl away from helicopter as rush of heat rolls over him and helicopter explodes in background with large boom. Bits of helicopter shards rain down around from explosion

**NARRATOR:**
"He tried to crawl away from the helicopter, knowing that it was probably going to explode, but the pain made it difficult to move. Not two seconds later, he heard a great boom and felt the massive wave of heat blast him, singing the hairs on the back of his neck. Shards of his helicopter rained down around him. There was no way the Korean woman would have made it out alive."

---

### THE BRIEFCASE & LIFE FORM 0

**DESCRIPTION:** Action shot of black briefcase slamming down and breaking open beside Kaiser after being thrown out of helicopter by explosion. Inside briefcase: cracked vial of green liquid containing small green and brown slug-like creature

**NARRATOR:**
"A thud resounded in the sand next to him, and Kaiser turned to see the briefcase the Korean woman had been so desperate to protect crash into the ground beside him, thrown free of the helicopter by the explosion and cracked open on the ground by the force of the impact."

**DESCRIPTION:** Close up of slug creature after getting out of vial. Crawling across briefcase towards where Kaiser is

**NARRATOR:**
"In the distance, Kaiser heard the Akrahuhum yelling to approach the helicopter with caution, in case there was a secondary explosion on the way. He turned his attention back to the open briefcase, desperate to find something inside that could help him. Instead, the whole case was completely empty except for a single vial of green fluid containing... something. It looked like a brown and green slug, and it squirmed under his gaze. The vial had cracked open during the explosion, and Kaiser watched as the slug-like creature began to worm its way free, moving towards Kaiser."

---

### PLAYING DEAD

**DESCRIPTION:** Extreme close up of Kaiser's eyes widening as he realizes footsteps approaching. Then full body shot of Kaiser playing dead in wreckage with briefcase open two feet away

**NARRATOR:**
"Footsteps pounded on the ground, and the voices of the Akrahuhum drew much closer now, almost right on him. Kaiser froze. Maybe if he played dead, they would ignore him. They weren't there for him, after all. He closed his eyes and forced his muscles to relax."

**DESCRIPTION:** Several shots of terrorists conversing. One where they face each other, another where one toes briefcase by Kaiser with boots, another of same terrorist bending down slightly over Kaiser's body to assess whether he is dead

**TERRORIST 1:** "Where is it?"

**TERRORIST 2:** "It's over here. By the pilot."

**TERRORIST 1:** "Is he dead?"

**TERRORIST 2:** "Yeah. Briefcase is open. Life Form 0 is not inside."

**TERRORIST 1:** "Damn it. Search the area."

---

### THE SLUG ENTERS KAISER

**DESCRIPTION:** Shot of slug creature beginning to crawl onto Kaiser's ear as he lies on ground pretending to be dead. Second shot of slug in shell of Kaiser's ear, beginning to crawl into ear canal. Inside shot of ear canal showing slug pushing past eardrum and into skull

**NARRATOR:**
"Eyes still closed, Kaiser felt something slimy against the inner shell of his ear. The feeling only intensified as he felt it slide right up to the entrance of his ear canal. His jaw tightened, grinding his teeth together in an effort to remain still despite the discomfort. Any movement he made could give him away. He bit his tongue as the thing, whatever it was, began to slide its way into his ear, gradually pushing inside. It wormed itself all the way inside the canal until it pressed against his ear drum painfully. There was nothing he could do - if he gave away that he was alive whatsoever, they would shoot him."

**DESCRIPTION:** Shot of Kaiser's face scrunching slightly in pain while still pretending to be dead. Second shot of Kaiser opening eyes and screaming what looks like blood-curdling howl of pain

**NARRATOR:**
"Kaiser's eyes nearly snapped wide open as he felt the slimy thing push past his ear drum. The pain intensified, burning like fire inside him, and it took everything in him not to scream. The thing kept pushing, and Kaiser bit down on his tongue so hard it bled. The pain was unbearable, like the thing was somehow worming its way into his very brain. It felt like his skull was splitting open, a hundred times worse than any migraine he'd ever experienced. Then, just when he thought that was the worst of it, an incredibly sharp pain spiked deep into the core of his brain, like someone had shoved an icepick into his skull. Kaiser screamed, unable to stop himself. The pain ceased immediately, but it was too late. He'd marked himself a dead man."

---

### CONFRONTATION WITH FAUD

**DESCRIPTION:** Aerial shot of at least seven terrorists surrounding Kaiser, all with guns trained on him. Lead terrorist from before has turned Kaiser over with boot and planted foot on Kaiser's chest. Rifle right up to Kaiser's face

**NARRATOR:**
"The terrorists surrounded Kaiser, all of their guns trained on him. The one in charge shoved him with his boot, putting his automatic rifle right in Kaiser's face so he was staring straight down the barrel."

**DESCRIPTION:** Close up on Kaiser and lead terrorist as lead terrorist snarls at Kaiser

**LEAD TERRORIST:** "Where is it?"

**KAISER EZIOBI:** "What?"

**LEAD TERRORIST:** "Life Form 0. Tell me where it is, or I'll kill you."

---

### THE FLOOD OF MEMORIES

**DESCRIPTION:** Close up on Kaiser's face scrunching up in discomfort. Second close up of Kaiser's forehead, like we are entering his mind

**NARRATOR:**
"Suddenly, Kaiser's mind felt too cramped, almost painfully so. Like there wasn't enough space inside his skull for all the things in it. A presence pushed at the edge of his consciousness, nudging him somewhere inside his brain. He followed its lead, pushing into the depths of his own mind. It felt like opening a floodgate."

**DESCRIPTION:** Series of blue-toned shots that glow ethereally:
- Young Nigerian boy, six years old, playing soccer in backyard garden
- Same boy slightly older beaming upwards with backpack on
- Boy as teenager slamming door to room shut looking very angry
- Teenage boy yelling in kitchen as if yelling at viewer
- Older teenage boy sneaking out and doing hazing ritual with local terrorist cell
- Boy now man with beard, packed bag in same kitchen, yelling angrily
- Around arm: band with symbol of Akrahuhum
- Front door slammed shut from perspective of person inside
- As boy grows into man, he begins to resemble lead terrorist
- Then dark

**NARRATOR:**
"Memories that were not his own poured into his skull. A child in a garden playing, that same boy with a backpack on his way to school. Then, the same boy, all grown up this time, locked away in his room. Kaiser recognized his face... it was the man who was now interrogating him. He saw arguments in the kitchen, pleading, desperate. Watched as the boy drifted away, becoming more and more secretive, barely coming home. A screaming match, and then he was gone. Whoever's memories he was experiencing never saw the boy again. The consciousness in the back of his head pushed a word to him - Miriam. Then, a deep sense of forgiveness washed over him, forgiveness which was not his own but her's, Miriam's. Forgiveness that only a mother could possess in her dying moments for her son. The presence pushed the boy's name into Kaiser's head, too. Faud. His mouth opened."

---

### REVEALING THE TRUTH

**DESCRIPTION:** Shot from Kaiser's POV looking up at lead terrorist towering over him

**KAISER:** "Faud."

**DESCRIPTION:** Shot from Kaiser's POV as terrorist looks angry and taken aback

**LEAD TERRORIST:** "I- what?"

**NARRATOR:** "Kaiser couldn't believe the words coming out of his mouth."

**DESCRIPTION:** Side shot of both Kaiser and terrorist. Kaiser looking up at terrorist with expression of both confusion and empathy. Terrorist looks extremely angry

**KAISER:** "Faud. That's your name."

**NARRATOR:** "The terrorist's mouth twitched. He shoved the barrel of the gun even closer to Kaiser's face."

**DESCRIPTION:** Close up of barrel of semi-automatic getting pressed more towards Kaiser's frightened face

**LEAD TERRORIST:** "Where did you hear that? I haven't gone by Faud in 10 years."

**DESCRIPTION:** Close up on Kaiser speaking

**KAISER:** "I... Your mother, Faud. She forgave you. Before she died. She forgave you. For leaving."

**DESCRIPTION:** Lingering side shot of Kaiser and Faud. Faud's gun still pointed at Kaiser, but face has gone slack with barely concealed sadness. Has begun to tear up

**NARRATOR:** "Faud's jaw tightened even more, and Kaiser watched as his eyes became wet with unshed tears."

**DESCRIPTION:** Close up of terrorist's face as it goes from barely concealed sadness to outright anger

**LEAD TERRORIST:** "Quiet, idiot! I'm not Faud. Not anymore."

**DESCRIPTION:** Close up of Kaiser speaking. Looks concerned and empathetic

**KAISER:** "Once you were. She loved you. And she kept loving you even after you decided to not be Faud anymore."

**DESCRIPTION:** Kaiser and Faud looking at each other, Faud's gun lowered slightly, dropping from Kaiser's face to chest. Faud looks incredibly depressed and lost

**NARRATOR:** "Faud stared at Kaiser, gun lowering slightly, eyes filling up with tears even as the man staunchly refused to blink and shed them."

**LEAD TERRORIST:** "My mother. What was her name?"

**KAISER:** "Miriam."

**NARRATOR:** "For a second, it seemed as if Faud might lower his gun entirely."

---

### FINAL CONFRONTATION

**DESCRIPTION:** Close up of Faud and Kaiser as Faud puts gun right on Kaiser's forehead and gets right up in his face, extremely angry that Kaiser had broken down his defenses for few seconds

**NARRATOR:** "Instead, Kaiser watched as the man's eyes steeled over and he put the barrel of his gun right up against Kaiser's forehead."

**LEAD TERRORIST:** "Who are you?"

**DESCRIPTION:** Close up of Kaiser closing eyes and taking deep breath with barrel of gun still right on forehead

**NARRATOR:**
"Kaiser thought about the question for a second. Who was he? Certainly he was different now than he had been not even a half hour before. He could still feel the alien presence pushing against the back of his mind. He didn't understand it yet, but he knew that the slug in the briefcase had somehow merged with his own mind and given him... something. Who was he? The only answer he had was that he was now somehow more than he had ever been. The presence nudged his mind again, supplying him with the right words."

**DESCRIPTION:** Kaiser opens eyes and looks up at where Faud would be if in frame

**KAISER:** "My name is Kaiser Eziobi. I keep the knowledge of the dead. I know all that is and all that has been. Shoot me, and you kill Life Form 0."
