## WRITING STYLE ANALYSIS

### Game of Thrones Influences Achieved
- **Multiple POV Structure:** 5 distinct voices, each chapter follows one character
- **Intimate Third Person:** Deep dive into thoughts and emotions
- **Morally Gray Characters:** Everyone has valid motivations, no pure heroes/villains
- **Political Intrigue:** Geopolitical maneuvering around LSW technology
- **Personal Stakes:** Every character fighting for something deeply personal
- **Foreshadowing:** Asha's timelines, Moses's unease, Karine's dangerous knowledge
- **Brutal Consequences:** Elena's death is sudden, unfair, permanent

### Tonal Consistency
- **Chapter 6 (Marcus):** Dark, violent, righteously angry
- **Chapter 7 (Raghavan):** Melancholic, dutiful, burdened
- **Chapter 8 (Karine):** Paranoid, morally conflicted, intellectually dazzling
- **Chapter 9 (Carlos):** Tragic, intimate, breaking point
- **Chapter 10 (Moses):** Mystical, reluctant, cosmic horror undertones

### Prose Techniques
- Short, punchy sentences for action and revelation
- Longer, flowing sentences for introspection and world-building
- Sensory details grounding each scene (rain at funeral, golden river, coffee steam)
- Internal monologue revealing character philosophy
- Dialogue revealing relationships and power dynamics
