## FAMILY REUNION (Cut from Chapter 1, will be used in Chapter 2)

### Scene: Sarah and Emily Arrive

Hartley's phone rang. He answered, listened, and stood. "Your family's helicopter is landing. I'll give you privacy for the reunion." He paused at the door. "Mr. Richards... I don't know if your story is true. But I hope to God it isn't. Because if you're right, we're in more danger than most people can comprehend."

"We are," Rusty confirmed. "But we have eight years. Eight years to prepare, to train, to become something more than what we are." He looked at Galloway. "Eight years to give humanity a fighting chance."

After Hartley left, Galloway pulled out a tablet and began taking notes. "I need you to walk me through the Alliance species. Start with—"

"Later," Rusty interrupted. Through the ambulance window, he could see a helicopter touching down on the football field, rotors kicking up dust and dried grass. The side door opened before it fully landed, and Sarah jumped out, her hair whipping in the downdraft, her face streaked with tears.

"We'll talk," Rusty said to Galloway. "But right now, I need to see the people I left behind."

He stepped out of the ambulance, and Sarah crashed into him like a wave, her arms wrapping around him so tightly he could barely breathe. She smelled like lavender shampoo and coffee and home. She was crying into his chest, saying his name over and over like a prayer.

Behind her, Emily emerged from the helicopter, moving slower, her eyes red but dry. She'd always been the strong one.

"You absolute bastard," Emily said when she reached him. Then she punched him in the shoulder—hard—and pulled him into a hug that made his ribs creak. "Two years, Rusty. Two goddamn years we thought you were dead."

"I know," he whispered. "I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."

"You better have a good explanation," Emily said fiercely. "And it better be better than 'aliens abducted me and sent me back to warn the world about an invasion.' Because even for you, that's—"

"It's true," Rusty interrupted. "Every word. I know how it sounds. But Emily, Sarah—" He pulled back enough to look at them both. "Everything I said in that press conference was true. In eight years, everything we know will end unless we fight. I need you to believe me."

Sarah touched his face gently, as if confirming he was real. "I believe you."

"I don't," Emily said bluntly. "But I believe that *you* believe it. And you've never lied to me before. So... I'll listen."

It wasn't faith. But it was a start.

### Scene: Telling Sarah and Emily Everything

As the sun set over Derby, painting the Australian sky in shades of orange and purple that painfully reminded Rusty of the vortex, he sat with his family in a military facility and told them everything. About the Grays' dimensional vessel. About Kor-Thalen and the other Gray scientists. About the Alliance of Four—the Iron Eaters with their self-evolving nanite bodies, the Slaught with their hive-mind swarms, the Deep with their ecosystem-destroying water manipulation, and the fourth species the Grays wouldn't name.

And about the Living Superweapons. The thousand men and women who would be chosen, enhanced, transformed. The powers they'd wield. The price they'd pay.

"Kor-Thalen showed me possible futures," Rusty said as darkness fell outside. "Not *the* future—they said time is more flexible than humans understand—but probable outcomes. I saw Earth burning. I saw our atmosphere processed into alien gas. I saw the last humans choking on toxic air, reaching for a sun they'd never see again."

He paused, looking at the faces of the women he loved.

"But I also saw another future. One where we fought back. Where these Living Superweapons stood against the Alliance and held the line long enough for humanity to evacuate. To survive. To scatter among the stars like seeds from a dying tree, carrying Earth's memory into the cosmos. That future is possible. Unlikely, but possible."

"Which future did the Grays think was most probable?" Sarah asked quietly.

Rusty met her eyes. "The one where we destroy ourselves before the Alliance even arrives. Where nations fight over the Living Superweapons instead of preparing for the invasion. Where fear and greed and pride blind us to the real threat until it's too late."

"Then we make sure that's not the future that happens," Emily said firmly. "You came back to warn us. Fine. Warning delivered. Now what?"

Now what, indeed.

Rusty thought of Vaughn Galloway, already planning SPEAR. Thought of the governments that would scramble to control the Living Superweapons. Thought of the eight years ticking away like a countdown to extinction.

"Now," he said, "we prepare for war."

**NOTES:**
This scene has great character work but slows Chapter 1's pacing too much. Moving it to Chapter 2 allows:
- Chapter 1 to focus solely on the return and public warning
- The reunion to have proper emotional space
- Sarah and Emily's characters to be properly introduced
- More realistic timeline (they can't get to Australia in 2 hours)
