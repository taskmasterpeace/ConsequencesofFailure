## KEY STORY MOMENTS

### 1. The Bus Crash (Year 1)
**Scene:** Origin story. Raghavan watches Nitya, Rohan, and Ria die. Armor manifests too late. Grief transforms into power. Survivor's guilt defines him.

### 2. Establishment 24 Formation (Year 2)
**Scene:** Randhawa recruits him. Raghavan accepts. Team building begins. Ganga cleanup becomes symbol of hope. "Divine warrior" imagery spreads.

### 3. Kedarnath Flood (Year 6-7) ⭐ ICONIC
**Scene:** Flash flood at pilgrimage site. Dozens drowning. Raghavan can only carry 4-5 at a time. **WHO LIVES? WHO DIES?**
- Grabs elderly woman, two children
- Young mother screaming for help
- Old man reaches for him, drowns
- Rescues 12 total
- **40+ die while he watches**
- Haunted by their faces forever
- "I'm supposed to be a hero but I let people die"
- **THE IMPOSSIBLE CHOICE**

### 4. Kaiser Recruitment Attempt (Year 3)
**Scene:** Kaiser Eziobi approaches Raghavan about Pan-African movement. "India's model can work for Africa." Raghavan interested but focused on India first. Mutual respect. Sets up Kaiser's assassination (USA fears India-Africa alliance).

### 5. Iron War Defense (Year 4-8)
**Scene:** Establishment 24 critical to India's survival during Iron Eater attacks. Raghavan's powers perfect for fighting nanite swarms (can't corrupt golden armor - different tech). India fares better than most nations thanks to E24.

### 6. Final Battle (Year 8)
**Scene:** Raghavan leads Establishment 24 against Alliance of Four. Divine warrior vs alien invaders. Possible cosmic destiny revealed - was he chosen by Grays specifically? Hindu mythology themes. Glory or sacrifice?

**Year 5-8:** Kedarnath flood breaks something in him. Realizes power has limits. Kaiser's death affects him (respected the vision). Iron War proves his value. India survives thanks to E24.
