SCRIPT




INT. MILITARY BASE - DAY
We see a group of soldiers training in hand-to-hand combat. One of them, TODD BENCHLEY (54), is standing in the middle of the group, watching and instructing. He is a no-nonsense kind of guy, and his face is lined with the scars of a life lived hard. He is wearing a black cowboy hat and a black M16 with a suppressor.
TODD: Alright, let's go again. This time, focus on your footwork and your positioning. (to the soldier on his right) John, remember to keep your weight evenly distributed on both feet. It will give you more stability and power in your strikes. (to the soldier on his left) Sarah, try to anticipate your opponent's moves and adjust your position accordingly. Don't get caught off guard.
The soldiers stop their sparring as they turn to see Vaughn Galloway (45) enter the room. His reputation as a wealthy and bold businessperson precedes him, along with his controversial past. To the soldiers, Vaughn Galloway is the man who paid a ransom of 1.5 million dollars to secure the release of their mentor, Todd Benchley, from terrorist captivity. To others, it was seen as a self-serving political move during a presidential election year, meant to sway public opinion and secure the presidency for Anthony Parker. It was a gamble that paid off, elevating the small town college president to the highest office in the land.
 With a sly smile, Vaughn approaches the training as Todd halts training and greets him.
TODD: (smiling) Vaughn, what brings you here?
VAUGHN: (smiling) Oh, I’m just here seeing how the training is going. And to talk to you about a new project I'm working on.
TODD: (intrigued) I've been seeing you all on TV lately talking about?  The one even my kids have been telling me that you were going to ask me to somehow get involved in? You want me to help you with a team that has something to do with aliens.
VAUGHN: This is special Todd. Can we talk in your office?
TODD:  (intrigued) Special? Sure.
Vaughn leads Todd to a nearby office, where they sit down.
VAUGHN: Todd, I need your help. Something big is about to happen, and I'm not sure the world's governments are ready for it.
TODD: (skeptical) I’ve heard you say that on TV, Vaughn. So who have you hired so far?
VAUGHN: (laughing) Todd, if I hired anyone before you I am certain you wouldn’t be a part of it.
VAUGHN: (leaning in) Todd, you’re the best person in the world for this job.
TODD: (chuckles) The 'best person in the world for the job'. Did your ai write that for you? 
VAUGHN: (smirks) No, Todd. I believe it because it's true. But I understand if you're hesitant. That's why I brought this. (he pulls out a tablet) This is all the information you will need as a member of the executive board.  need to make an informed decision. It includes intelligence reports, eyewitness accounts, and classified documents related to extraterrestrial threats against humanity. It also includes details on the mission and goals of SPEAR, which is to advance human knowledge and understanding of the universe by researching these threats and developing a tactical or scientific response to them. The information on this tablet suggests that SPEAR will be working to protect humanity from possible extraterrestrial threats, as well as searching for new technology or life forms that could improve human life.


VAUGHN: (nodding) It's a new organization I'm putting together. Special Personnel for Extraterrestrial Assault and Research. Our mission is to investigate, defend against and research extraterrestrial threats around the world, the governments of the world.
TODD: (skeptical) Extraterrestrial threats? So you think there is an extraterrestrial threat out there that no one knows about except you.
VAUGHN: (nodding) I know it sounds crazy, but something is happening. We arn’t sure what, yet but I've got intelligence reports, classified documents, and eyewitness accounts from reliable sources all around the world.. It's all there, on this tablet. (holds out tablet)
TODD: (skeptical) I'm not sure, Vaughn. This all seems a little far-fetched to me. And even if it's true, I'm not sure I'm the right person for the job. I'm getting up there in age, and I don't need the money or the stress. I'm happy with my life right now.
VAUGHN: (nodding) That's exactly what I want. I know it sounds crazy, but I've seen the evidence. I've got intelligence reports, classified documents, and eyewitness accounts from reliable sources. It's all here, on this tablet. (holds out tablet) This tablet will self-destruct in 24 hours, and I need you to read through all the information before it's gone.
TODD: (pauses for a moment, then nods) Okay, Vaughn. I'll take a look
TODD: (hesitant) I don't know, Vaughn. This is a lot to take in.


VAUGHN: (leaning in) Todd, look at the first report, right? The one about the person who was burned to a crisp on the inside but not on the outside?
TODD: (nodding) Yeah, I saw it. But I haven't had a chance to read it yet. What's the deal with that?
VAUGHN: (intense) It's an X-File, Todd. Whoever did it, left a corpse on a sea bearing United States Military vessel.  The navy scientists performed an autopsy, didn't believe what they were seeing and they called us for help.  And what we found was nothing short of extraordinary. Inside the body, of this woman they found trace elements of a gas that is not found on Earth or even in this solar system.
TODD: (stunned) Are you kidding me?
VAUGHN: (serious) I wish I was. Todd, this is just the tip of the iceberg. There are dozens of other reports like this one, all over the world. And if we don't do something about it, who knows
what could h
TODD: (to himself) I can't turn my back on this. I have to lead SPEAR.
Todd stands up, determined. He picks up the laptop and heads for the door.appen?
TODD: (pensive) I see your point. But what do you want me to do?
VAUGHN: (determined) I want you to lead SPEAR, Todd. Special Personnel for Extraterrestrial Assault and Research. It's a new organization I'm putting together. We can do things that the governments can't, and they'll hire us for services that they can't do themselves. We'll be the ones on the front lines, protecting humanity and seeking out new technology to improve our lives.
TODD: (thinking) I'll have to think about it.
VAUGHN: (understanding) I understand. But please, Todd, don't take too long. The clock is ticking, and I need to know if you're in or out.
TODD: (nodding) I'll let you know as soon as I can.
VAUGHN: (nodding) Thank you, Todd. I appreciate it. (stands up) I'll leave you to it, then. (exits the office)
Todd watches him go, his mind racing with the implications of what he's just heard. He has a lot to consider, and he knows he needs to make a decision soon. But first, he has to read through the rest of the evidence on the tablet and see for himself if it's really true.


INT. VAUGHN'S OFFICE - DAY


Todd sits at a desk, staring at a laptop screen. He is deep in thought. He picks up the tablet that Vaughn gave him and starts scrolling through the documents on it.
Shaking his head.


TODD: (to himself) This can't be real. Aliens? It's crazy. But the evidence is right here in front of me.
Todd's cellphone rings, and he answers it.


TODD: (into phone) Hello?
It's Sarah, one of the soldiers from the training room.


SARAH: (on the phone) Hey Todd, it's Sarah. I just wanted to let you know that John is in the hospital. He fell and hit his head during training.


TODD: (concerned) Oh no, is he okay?


SARAH: (on the phone) Yeah, he's going to be fine. They're just keeping him overnight for observation. But I thought you should know.


TODD: (nodding) Thanks for letting me know, Sarah. I'll come by and visit him tomorrow.


SARAH: (on the phone) Okay, thanks Todd.
Todd hangs up the phone and goes back to studying the documents on the laptop. He knows what he has to do.



INT. MILITARY BASE - DAY


Todd walks into the training room, where the soldiers are still sparring. He approaches Vaughn, who is standing on the side of the room.
TODD: (determined) I'm in. I'll lead SPEAR.
VAUGHN: (pleased) Excellent! I knew I could count on you, Todd. You won't regret this.
TODD: (serious) I hope not. But I have one condition.
VAUGHN: (curious) What's that?
TODD: (firm) I want full autonomy. I don't want anyone looking over my shoulder or telling me what to do. I'll report to you, but I need to have control over my team and the mission.
VAUGHN: (nodding) I understand. You have my word that you'll have complete control.
TODD: (nodding) Good. Then let's get started.
VAUGHN: (excited) Absolutely. We have a lot of work to do.
The two men shake hands, sealing their deal. The camera pans out, showing the soldiers training in the background as Todd and Vaughn walk out of the room, ready to tackle their new mission.




V1 INT. TODD'S HOUSE - DAY


Todd is in the garage, working on his motorcycle engine. His two children, MIKE (20) and LISA (18), are standing in the doorway, watching him. Mike is leaning against the doorframe with his arms crossed, while Lisa is fidgeting nervously.


MIKE: So, Dad, we heard about this SPEAR thing on the news. It seems like Vaughn has been hyping it up, trying to get Congress to provide additional funding.


Todd's eyes narrow, his jaw clenched in frustration. He stops what he's doing and turns to look at his children.


TODD: Yeah, I've heard about it too.


LISA: (hesitant) We know you've been approached to join. And we know about Vaughn.


TODD: (sighs) Yeah, I've been approached. But I haven't made a decision yet.


MIKE: (frustrated) How can you even consider it? After everything Vaughn's done with Cheat Check?


TODD: (defensive) I know what he's done. But I also know what he did for me. He paid 1.5 million dollars to free me from being a POW. I owe him.


LISA: (angry) How can you say that? He's a sleaze. And he's only using you because he needs your military expertise for SPEAR. Plus, my best friend was really hurt by Cheat Check. I can't believe you would even consider working with him.


TODD: (calming) First off, Vaughn may have made some questionable business decisions, but he also risked his own life and resources to save mine. I would still be tied to a chair with an AK-47 pointed at my head making hostage videos if not for him. It's not a simple equation.


Second, Vaughn is one of the richest people on this planet not because of luck or an inheritance. It's because he is also one of the smartest people on this planet. If he believes there is an alien threat out there that we don't see just yet, it's hard for me to doubt him.
I understand your concern. But I need to do what I think is right. I'll make sure to weigh all of the pros and cons before making a final decision.
LISA: (nodding) I just want what's best for you, Dad.
TODD: (smiling) I know, Lisa. And I appreciate that. I'll make sure to keep you both in the loop on my decision.
Mike and Lisa exchange a look, both still unsure about their father's choice. Todd turns back to the car engine, deep in thought.

INT. MILITARY BASE - DAY
We see a group of soldiers training in hand-to-hand combat. One of them, TODD BENCHLEY (54), is standing in the middle of the group, watching and instructing. He is a no-nonsense kind of guy, and his face is lined with the scars of a life lived hard. He is wearing a black cowboy hat and a black M16 with a suppressor.
TODD: Alright, let's go again. This time, focus on your footwork and your positioning. (to soldier on his right) John, remember to keep your weight evenly distributed on both feet. It will give you more stability and power in your strikes. (to the soldier on his left) Sarah, try to anticipate your opponent's moves and adjust your position accordingly. Don't get caught off guard.
The soldiers start to spar again, and Todd watches them carefully, offering specific advice and guidance to each one. Suddenly, his attention is drawn to the door, where his friend and former boss VAUGHN GALLOWAY (45) is standing. Vaughn is a wealthy internet entrepreneur who hires Todd as a private military contractor.
VAUGHN: Todd, can I have a word?
TODD: Sure, what's up?
Vaughn leads Todd to a nearby office, where they sit down.
VAUGHN: Todd, I need your help. Something big is about to happen, and I'm not sure the world's governments are ready for it.
TODD: (skeptical) What are you talking about?
VAUGHN: (leaning in) Todd, I know you're the man for the job. You've always been able to handle anything that comes your way. You're a warrior, a protector, and a mentor. You have all the skills and experience necessary to lead SPEAR.


TODD: (raises an eyebrow) SPEAR? What is that?
VAUGHN: (nodding) It's a new organization I'm putting together. Special Personnel for Extraterrestrial Assault and Research. Our mission is to defend against and research extraterrestrial threats around the world, in order to advance human knowledge and understanding of the universe.
TODD: (skeptical) Extraterrestrial threats? You think there are aliens out there trying to attack us?
VAUGHN: (nodding) I know it sounds crazy, but I've seen the evidence. I've got intelligence reports, classified documents, and eyewitness accounts from reliable sources. It's all here, on this tablet. (holds out tablet)
TODD: (hesitant) I don't know, Vaughn. This is a lot to take in.

VAUGHN: (nodding) Thank you, Todd. I appreciate it. (stands up) I'll leave you to it, then. (exits the office)
Todd watches him go, his mind racing with the implications of what he's just heard. He remembers his own experiences with extraterrestrial encounters as a POW, and how Vaughn had helped him out of that situation. Todd owes Vaughn a debt of gratitude, but he's not sure if he's ready to take on such a risky and unknown mission.


INT. TODD'S HOUSE - DAY
Todd is sitting at the kitchen table with his two children, MIKE (22) and LISA (20). They are both in college, and they both know about Todd's past with Vaughn.
MIKE: So, what did Vaughn want?
TODD: (sighs) He wants me to lead this new organization he's starting called SPEAR.
LISA: (sarcastic) SPEAR? Sounds like a bunch of macho nonsense.
TODD: (defensive) It's not nonsense, Lisa. It's a team of highly trained professionals who are dedicated to defending against and researching extraterrestrial threats around the world.
LISA: (rolls her eyes) Yeah, right. And what, you're just going to go running off on some wild goose chase after aliens?
TODD: (serious) Lisa, I know it sounds crazy, but Vaughn has evidence. He showed me classified documents and eyewitness accounts. He's convinced that there are real threats out there that we need to be prepared for.
MIKE: (thoughtful) I can see why you'd want to help, Dad. But are you sure this is the right move for you?
TODD: (pensive) I don't know, son. I've got a lot to think about.
LISA: (sarcastic) Yeah, like how much money you're going to make off this venture. I bet Vaughn's paying you a ton to be his puppet.
TODD: (angry) That's not fair, Lisa. Vaughn's always been there for me, and I owe him a debt of gratitude.
LISA: (angry) Oh, I see. So you're just going to forget about all the people he's screwed over with his company, Cheat Check? Do you remember my friend, the one who was falsely accused of cheating and nearly lost her scholarship because of Cheat Check's faulty algorithms?
MIKE: (interrupting) Wait, what? I didn't know about that.
LISA: (sighs) Yeah, well, it's just one example of how Vaughn doesn't care about anyone but himself. He's always looking for ways to make a profit, no matter who gets hurt in the process.
TODD: (sighs) I understand your concerns, Lisa. But I also know that Vaughn can be a good man when he wants to be. He's offered to pay for my son's medical school tuition, and I can't ignore that kind of generosity.
MIKE: (surprised) He did what? Dad, I never told you I accepted his offer.
TODD: (surprised) What do you mean? He sent me the contracts and everything.
MIKE: (hesitant) Yeah, well, I was going to tell you, but I was embarrassed. I didn't want anyone to know that I was going to med school because of Vaughn.
LISA: (sarcastic) Oh, of course


________________
TODD’s PERSPECTIVE


After a quick shower and a strong cup of coffee, I head to the base, my mind already running through the day's training exercises. But as I'm getting into the swing of things, my old friend and former boss, Vaughn Galloway, interrupts me


Vaughn is a wealthy internet entrepreneur who often hires me for various private military contracting jobs. He's a smart guy, but I have to admit, I'm a little surprised when he tells me about his latest project. He's convinced that there are aliens out there and wants me to lead a team to hunt them down.


At first, I'm skeptical. It all seems a little far-fetched to me. But as Vaughn shows me classified documents and intelligence reports, I start to see that there might be some truth to his claims. And when he tells me about the person who was found burned to a crisp on the inside but not on the outside, I can't deny that something strange is going on.


Despite my reservations, I decided to take on the challenge of leading SPEAR. It's an opportunity to do something truly meaningful and important, something that could potentially protect humanity. Plus, as a tactician with a knack for thinking on my feet and a follower of the 48 laws of power, I know that this could be a valuable opportunity to flex my strategic muscles.


So, I accept Vaughn's offer and begin assembling a team of skilled professionals to join me on this journey. It's going to be a long and difficult road, but I'm ready for the challenge. As I sit in my office, planning our next move and sharpening my tactical genius, I can't help but feel a sense of excitement and purpose. This is what I was born to do.


I head home after a long day of training and planning for SPEAR, my mind still racing with ideas and strategies. As I walk through the door, I'm greeted by the familiar sounds and smells of home. My two grown kids, Max and Rachel, are both out at college, but I still keep the house feeling warm and welcoming for when they come to visit.


I pour myself a drink and sink into my favorite armchair, letting out a sigh of relief. It's been a long day, but it's days like these that make me feel alive. I'm a man who has always lived on the edge, and I can't imagine living any other way.


But as I sit here, relaxing and enjoying my drink, I can't help but think about the baggage that I still carry with me. The memories of my time as a POW, the scars that line my face and body, the guilt that I feel for not being there for my kids as they were growing up. It's not easy, being a man who has lived a life like mine.


But as I sit here, I also can't help but feel a sense of gratitude towards Vaughn. After all, it was him who paid the ransom to the terrorists who were holding me hostage. I'll never forget the day that he showed up with a team of mercenaries and freed me and my team. It was a risky move, but one that paid off in the end.


I'll be forever grateful to Vaughn for that. He's not just my boss and friend, he's a true brother in arms. And as I sit here, thinking about all that he's done for me, I know that I owe it to him to give this new mission my all. 
So, I take a deep breath and stand up, ready to tackle whatever the world throws at me. I may be carrying some baggage, but I'm not going to let it weigh me down. I'm Todd Benchley, and I'm ready for anything.


VAUGHNS PERSPECTIVE


As I sit in my luxurious office, staring out at the city skyline, I can't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. I've built a successful business from the ground up, and I have no intention of stopping now.
But as I flip through the latest intelligence reports, I can't shake the feeling that there's something more going on here. Something big. Something that could change the world.
I've stumbled upon evidence of an intelligent alien AI operating in the field. It's unlike anything I've ever seen before, and I have a sneaking suspicion that there are many more out there like it. And if I can get my hands on one of these AIs, the possibilities are endless.
I know that I need a team of skilled professionals to help me achieve this goal. That's where Todd comes in. He's a former POW and private military contractor, a tactician with a knack for thinking on his feet and a follower of the 48 laws of power. He's the perfect man for the job.
So, I offer Todd the chance to lead SPEAR, my new organization: Special Personnel for Extraterrestrial Assault and Research. It's a risky move, but I have a feeling that Todd is the man for the job. He's a warrior, a protector, and a mentor. He has all the skills and experience necessary to lead this team to success.
As I sit here, staring at Todd across the desk, I can't help but feel a sense of excitement. This could be the biggest discovery in the history of mankind, and I'm not going to let anyone else get in our way. We're going to be the ones on the front lines, protecting humanity and seeking out new technology to improve our lives.
