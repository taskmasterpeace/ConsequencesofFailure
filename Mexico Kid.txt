Alright, there is a lot of information here. Let me break it down into the key points that might be useful for your geopolitical film.


1. **Cartel dynamics**: The drug trade in Mexico was largely managed under the leadership of El Chapo, the head of the Sinaloa Cartel, who ran the organization like a corporation. Following his arrest and imprisonment, the power dynamics in the cartel world changed drastically.


2. **Current Cartel Landscape**: The Sinaloa Cartel's power diminished, giving rise to the Jalisco New Generation Cartel. This cartel is far more violent and ruthless, viewing the drug business as a war. They've expanded into other industries like agriculture, transport, tourism, and local government. 


3. **Potential Threat**: While the Jalisco New Generation Cartel's presence in the US is limited currently, the fear is that if they manage to bring the Mexican drug war north of the border, it could pose a significant challenge that US law enforcement may not be equipped to handle.


4. **Geographical Challenges**: Northern Mexico, with its arid, mountainous, and largely uninhabited terrain, makes it a challenging region to secure, likening it to Afghanistan.


5. **US Politics**: The Trump administration led to shifts within the Republican Party, leading to the rise of populism and the sidelining of some traditionally important factions, such as the business community, fiscal conservatives, and the national security community. 


6. **Political Spectrum**: The US population can be segmented into four main groups based on their economic and social beliefs. These groups can swing the balance in political elections, depending on the issues being debated.


7. **Election Dynamics**: Democrats have struggled due to their factions having varied beliefs. On the other hand, Republicans have traditionally maintained a tight coalition, though the Trump era has led to changes within this as well.
