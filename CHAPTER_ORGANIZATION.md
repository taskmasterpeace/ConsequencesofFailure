# COF CHAPTER ORGANIZATION SYSTEM
## How to Structure Stories Across 8 Years

---

## THE PROBLEM:
Saying "Chapter 2" is confusing because:
- Chapter 2 of WHAT? The whole story? One character's arc? One year?
- Readers lose track of timeline
- Writers lose track of what's been covered

---

## THE SOLUTION: NUMBERED ARCS BY YEAR + CHARACTER

### FORMAT:
**[YEAR].[CHAPTER] - [CHARACTER]: [Title]**

**Examples:**
- **1.1 - Rusty: The Return**
- **1.6 - Raghavan: The Bus Crash**
- **4.12 - Global: The Iron War Begins**

**Why This Works:**
- **Year number** tells you WHEN
- **Chapter number** tells you order within that year
- **Character name** tells you WHOSE story
- **Title** tells you what happens

---

## HOW TO USE THIS SYSTEM:

### WHEN WRITING:
1. Pick a character/storyline you want to write
2. Find it in the year structure above
3. Write that chapter with proper numbering
4. Example: Writing Raghavan's origin? That's **1.6 - Raghavan: The Bus Crash**

### WHEN DISCUSSING:
- "I'm working on 1.6" = Everyone knows you mean Raghavan's bus crash, Year 1
- "Let's plan out Year 4" = Clear what timeframe we're discussing
- "Liu's arc in Year 3" = His gameshow and wavering loyalty chapters

### FLEXIBILITY:
- Add chapters as needed (1.6a, 1.6b if you need to split)
- Skip chapters in early drafts (don't have to write in order)
- Some characters get more chapters than others (that's fine!)
- Minor characters can share chapters ("Global:" POV switches)

---

## CHAPTER LENGTH GUIDE:

**Standard Chapter:** 2,500-5,000 words
**Short Chapter (Action/Transition):** 1,500-2,500 words
**Long Chapter (Epic Scene):** 5,000-8,000 words

**Book Length:** ~80,000-120,000 words per year
**Chapters Per Book:** ~20-30 chapters

---

## CURRENT STATUS:

✅ **DONE:**
- 1.1 - Rusty: The Return (CHAPTER_1_CORRECTED.md)
- 1.2 - Rusty: The Reunion (CUT_SCENES.md, needs assembly)

🎬 **WRITE NEXT:**
- 1.3 - Rusty: The Debriefing
- 1.6 - Raghavan: The Bus Crash
- 1.10 - Kaiser: The Extraction
- 1.14 - Unknown: The Vanishing

---

## ASSEMBLY STRATEGY:

### OPTION A: Write Chronologically
Write 1.1, then 1.2, then 1.3, etc. in order.

**Pros:** Natural flow, easy to track
**Cons:** Might get boring, can't skip ahead to exciting scenes

### OPTION B: Write By Character
Write all Rusty chapters, then all Raghavan, then all Kaiser.

**Pros:** Stay in character voice, deep immersion
**Cons:** Harder to track timeline connections

### OPTION C: Write Priority Scenes First
Write the ICONIC scenes (Kaiser assassination, Kedarnath flood, Iron War), then fill gaps.

**Pros:** Get exciting stuff done, motivating
**Cons:** Might miss important setup/transitions

### RECOMMENDED: HYBRID
Write some key scenes (priority), then fill in character arcs as needed. Use SCENE_LIBRARY.md to track what's done vs what's needed.

---

**NEXT UPDATE:** Mark chapters as ✅ DONE when written, add new chapters as story evolves.
