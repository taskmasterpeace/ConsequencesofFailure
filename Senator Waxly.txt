My fellow Americans, I stand before you today with a heavy heart, as I am deeply troubled by the recent actions of our newly elected President, Parker. His decision to sign the Lethal SuperWeapon Threshold Treaty without consulting the American people is not only an affront to our democracy, but it is also a violation of our fundamental rights and freedoms as citizens of this great nation.


As your Senator, I am committed to fighting against this treaty and all that it represents. The treaty is in direct violation of the 10th amendment, which protects our states’ rights. It also undermines our 2nd amendment rights by banning superpowered individuals from being used in any military conflict. This is a clear infringement on our right to bear arms, and we will not stand for it.


Furthermore, this treaty gives the United Nations Security Council, which includes countries like China and Russia, the authority to investigate and enforce the treaty. This is a direct threat to our sovereignty as a nation, and we will not stand for it.


President Parker must understand that he cannot treat this country like his hometown college campus. We are a nation of laws, and those laws must be followed. I urge my fellow Americans to join me in speaking out against this treaty. Myself and my colleagues in the Senate, including Senator Miller, will do everything in our power to stop this dangerous and unconstitutional treaty from being ratified.


I also call on the American people to email the biggest and most visible stain on the fabric of America, Mr. Vaughn Galloway, and ask him how many games of golf with the President did it take for him to be convinced to sign this treaty? I have no doubt that it took a significant amount of persuasion for him to sell out our country.


This treaty is an attack on our freedoms and our way of life, and it will not be tolerated. I urge President Parker to reconsider his actions and listen to the voices of the American people. Together, we can stop this treaty and defend our rights and liberties.


Now, I would like to hand the floor over to Senator Miller, who will be discussing the implications of this treaty on our national security. Thank you for your attention, and I urge you to stay engaged and informed as we work to protect our rights and freedoms.
