Read the arc, over and over, and these are my thoughts. First, let me answer the questions
Cultural Elements: What are popular sports or pastimes in Nigeria that can be included? How do Nigerians typically respond to betrayal in business? 
The most popular sport in Nigeria is football (not American football), the one you call “soccer.” 
I don't think Nigerians have a peculiar way of reacting to betrayal, so there isn't much to say there. We will just go with whatever feels best for the story.
Public Response to Justus' Betrayal: Would people in Nigeria rally in support of Justus against Kaiser? What would be the societal reaction?
Absolutely not. Most Nigerians are homophobic.
Things we can do to create nuance:
Kaiser is Igbo but was born in Lagos, which is Yoruba. He struggles with his identity as Igbos don't consider him Igbo enough because he cannot speak the language fluently (a common problem with diaspora Igbo people), and Yorubas don't accept him as one of them even though he has lived there all his life and speaks the language perfectly. We explore this in episode 1. Kaiser travels to the village for Christmas as a kid, where he encounters his roots for the first time. He also meets a girl there whom he develops a huge crush on, and he is sad when they have to go because of her. He later meets her again in episode 3, at the time his life is hitting rock bottom, so he cannot connect with her anymore.
Kaiser’s struggle to fit on is one of the reasons he betrayed Justus because he wanted to stand with straight people.
Also, in episode 2, when Kiaser and Justus meet, let's make a vague indication that Kaiser thinks he is gay but immediately pushes the thought away. Let's make it subtle so the viewers instantly think he is
