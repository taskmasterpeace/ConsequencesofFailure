## CHAPTER 6: MARCUS "STAMPEDE" WILLIAMS (USA)
### "The Reckoning"

**Chicago, Illinois - Year 2, Month 3**

The rain fell like judgment on Graceland Cemetery.

Marcus Williams stood at the back of the crowd, watching his brothers in blue huddle under their umbrellas. They'd come in force—the entire 14th Precinct, dress uniforms crisp despite the downpour. Commissioner Yates himself stood at the graveside, words about honor and sacrifice dripping from his mouth like the rain from the leaves above.

Shanice's casket gleamed despite the gray sky. Mahogany. Brass handles. The kind of send-off the department gave when they wanted to look good. When they needed the optics.

Marcus's hands curled into fists inside his coat pockets.

"Beautiful service," someone murmured beside him. Officer Donnelly, patrol. Worked with Shanice for three years. Probably believed what he was saying. Probably didn't know.

Marcus said nothing. He watched Headly and Reynolds standing in the second row, heads bowed, hands clasped. Playing their parts perfectly. The grieving colleagues. The shocked witnesses. The officers who'd "tried everything" to save her.

The lie sat heavy on Marcus's tongue. He'd tasted it before—that particular flavor of corruption that disguised itself as procedure. He'd swallowed it himself when his partner planted evidence on a kid in Englewood. When the union rep told him that reporting Hayes for excessive force would "ruin his career." When looking the other way became easier than standing up.

But this was Shanice.

His cousin. His sister in everything but blood. The girl who'd bandaged his knees when they were kids, who'd talked him through his academy fears, who'd texted him just three hours before Headly's bullets found her chest.

*"Marc, something's off with this stop. Headly's acting weird. Call you after."*

There was no after.

The dashcam footage played in Marcus's mind on endless loop. Shanice's hands raised. Headly's gun drawn. "She's reaching!" Three shots. Shanice falling. Then the throwaway piece—that Saturday night special Headly kept in his trunk—planted in Shanice's purse while Reynolds blocked the camera with his body.

Marcus had watched that footage forty-seven times before Internal Affairs "lost" it. Before the investigation became a formality. Before the DA—who golfed with the Commissioner—declined to prosecute.

*Insufficient evidence.*

The crowd began to disperse. Shanice's mother collapsed into her sister's arms, her wails cutting through the rain like knives. Marcus started toward her, then stopped. What could he say? That he knew the truth? That he had proof? That the system he'd sworn to serve had murdered her daughter and called it justified?

That he'd stood at the edge of the abyss for eighty-three days, taken by lights he couldn't explain, returned with something burning under his skin that made him *more* than he'd been?

"Williams."

Marcus turned. Captain Stokes approached, collar turned up against the rain. His face was stone, but his eyes held something Marcus couldn't quite read.

"Good of you to come," Stokes said.

"She was family."

"I know." Stokes glanced toward the dispersing crowd, toward Headly and Reynolds climbing into separate unmarked cars. "Internal Affairs cleared them. Nothing we can do."

Marcus's jaw tightened. "Nothing?"

"The investigation was thorough. The shooting was—"

"Bullshit." The word came out harder than Marcus intended. "You know it. I know it. Everyone in this cemetery knows it."

Stokes's face darkened. "Watch yourself, Williams. I understand you're grieving, but that kind of talk—"

"What? What will it do, Captain? Get me transferred? Make me a target?" Marcus stepped closer, rain streaming down his face. "Shanice did everything right. She followed procedure. She was clean, by the book, perfect. And she's dead because Headly's a murderer and Reynolds helped him cover it up."

"You have proof of that?" Stokes's voice dropped low. "Because unless you can show me something IA missed, you need to stand down. For your own good."

For his own good. Marcus had heard that before. The refrain of the blue wall. The anthem of looking away.

"Yeah," Marcus said quietly. "I understand."

He did. Finally. Completely.

The system wasn't broken. It was working exactly as designed.

---

**South Chicago - That Night**

The warehouse on 47th had been abandoned for six years, since the steel mill closed. Marcus found it three days after he'd woken up on the same street corner where the lights had taken him.

Eighty-three days gone. Vanished in a flash of white that no camera caught, no witness saw. When he came back, his partner Gutierrez hugged him so hard Marcus thought his ribs would crack.

Except they didn't.

His ribs felt like iron beneath his skin.

Now, in the darkness of the warehouse, Marcus faced the wall he'd been testing himself against for the past two weeks. Concrete block. Three feet thick. Reinforced steel rebar.

He thought of Shanice. Of Headly's smirk during the investigation. Of the Commissioner's empty words at the funeral.

Marcus hit the wall.

The impact would have shattered a normal man's hand. Instead, the concrete exploded outward, dust and debris erupting in a cloud that choked the air. Marcus pulled his fist back, knuckles unmarked, and stared at the crater he'd made.

Six feet deep. The rebar twisted like taffy.

"Jesus," he whispered.

He'd known he was stronger. The Grays—those alien things that had taken him—had changed him somehow. Enhanced him. Made his muscles denser, his bones harder, his skin resistant to cuts and impacts that should have torn him apart.

But this?

Marcus ran. Not jogging. *Running.* His legs pumped like pistons, feet barely touching ground, the warehouse blurring around him as he circled it once, twice, faster, faster, until the wind screamed and his lungs burned and he had to stop before he ran through the walls.

He checked his watch. Forty seconds. He'd just run three miles in forty seconds.

The warehouse creaked in the sudden stillness. Marcus bent over, hands on knees, breathing hard but not as hard as he should be. His body recovered too fast. His heart already slowing to normal. The burning in his muscles already fading.

He straightened, looking at his hands in the dim light filtering through the broken windows.

These hands could tear through metal. Could run at highway speeds. Could do things that would make him a weapon, a monster, a—

*A consequence.*

The thought crystallized like ice in his mind.

He'd spent his whole career enforcing consequences. You break the law, you face justice. Except justice was a lie when the ones enforcing it were the ones breaking it. When the system protected its own no matter the cost. When a good cop died and her killers walked free because the truth was inconvenient.

Someone had to be the consequence for that.

Someone had to make Headly and Reynolds face what they'd done.

Someone had to show the world that the blue wall wasn't invincible.

Marcus pulled out his phone. Opened the encrypted backup of Shanice's dashcam footage he'd saved before IA seized the original. Watched it one more time. Memorized every frame. Every lie. Every detail.

Then he deleted it.

He didn't need evidence anymore. He didn't need proof or procedure or the system that had failed Shanice. He didn't need to convince a jury or persuade a judge or hope that somewhere, somehow, the machinery would work.

He just needed to be fast enough that they couldn't run.

And strong enough that they couldn't fight back.

---

**Officer Headly's Apartment - Two Days Later**

Headly lived in Bridgeport, third floor of a walk-up near 35th and Morgan. Good neighborhood for cops. Quiet. Safe.

Marcus watched from across the street as Headly's lights went on at 11 PM. End of shift. The killer had probably stopped for a beer, maybe swung by Reynolds' place to laugh about the funeral, about how they'd pulled it off, about how that bitch Shanice had gotten what she deserved for poking her nose where it didn't belong.

The rage that thought brought made Marcus's vision blur red.

He forced it down. Controlled it. He'd learned control during those eighty-three days. Whatever the Grays had done to him, however they'd changed him, they'd also given him something else. Clarity. Focus. The ability to channel everything he felt into a single point.

Headly's apartment lights went out at 11:47 PM.

Marcus crossed the street at 11:48.

He didn't knock. The door lock was cheap brass. It shattered under his grip like plastic. The door swung open silently on well-oiled hinges.

Headly's apartment was exactly what Marcus expected. Sports memorabilia. Beer cans. Dirty dishes. The smell of takeout and stale sweat. The living room of a man who'd stopped trying.

Or maybe never started.

Marcus moved through the darkness like smoke. Enhanced vision let him see in the dim glow from the window. Enhanced hearing picked up Headly's snoring from the bedroom, heavy and irregular. The sleep of someone who thought they'd gotten away with it.

The bedroom door was open. Headly lay sprawled across his bed, one arm hanging off the side, mouth open. His service weapon sat on the nightstand within easy reach.

Marcus stared at it. At the gun that might have been the same model that killed Shanice. At the badge sitting next to it, gleaming in the streetlight filtering through the blinds.

He could end it now. Quick. Clean. Headly would never wake up.

But that would be mercy.

Marcus reached out and touched Headly's shoulder.

The man jerked awake, hand scrabbling for his gun. Marcus caught his wrist before his fingers touched metal. Squeezed. Not hard enough to break. Just hard enough to make the point.

Headly's eyes went wide. "Who the fuck—Williams?"

"Hello, Tom."

Recognition. Then confusion. Then fear. Marcus watched it play across Headly's face like a movie. The man tried to pull away. Marcus held him effortlessly, like holding a child.

"What the fuck are you doing in my house?" Headly's voice pitched higher. "You're breaking like five laws—"

"Say her name."

"What?"

Marcus's grip tightened. Bones creaked. "Say her name. The woman you murdered."

Headly's face went pale. "I don't—it wasn't murder, it was a clean shoot, she was—"

"*Say her name.*"

"Shanice!" It came out as a shriek. "Shanice Williams, okay? Jesus Christ, let go, you're breaking my fucking arm!"

Marcus pulled him out of bed like he weighed nothing. Headly stumbled, tried to throw a punch. Marcus caught it. Headly's fist hit Marcus's palm and stopped like it had hit a wall.

"I watched the footage," Marcus said quietly. "Before IA destroyed it. I watched you murder my cousin. I watched you plant that gun. I watched Reynolds block the camera. I watched you lie."

Headly's face crumbled. "Look, man, I didn't—it wasn't supposed to—she was going to report us, okay? She found out about the guns we were moving and she was going to fucking report us and ruin everything—"

The confession hit Marcus like a physical blow. Part of him had hoped. Hoped it was an accident. Hoped there was some explanation. Hoped the world wasn't as broken as it seemed.

But Headly just kept talking.

"—and Reynolds said we could make it look clean, said we could say she pulled on us, and I panicked, okay? I fucking panicked! But it worked, right? IA cleared us, the DA dropped it, nobody knows—"

"I know," Marcus said.

Headly looked up at him. Really looked. Saw something in Marcus's eyes that made him start shaking.

"Marcus, please. Please, man, we were brothers. We worked together, we—"

"We were never brothers." Marcus lifted Headly off the ground with one hand, watching him dangle, watching his feet kick uselessly. "Brothers don't murder family. Brothers don't lie. Brothers don't hide behind badges while they destroy lives."

"What are you—Jesus Christ, what *are* you?"

Marcus carried him to the window. Opened it one-handed, Headly clutched in the other, the cool Chicago night air rushing in.

"I'm a consequence," Marcus said.

Then he threw Headly through it.

Three stories. Not high enough to kill. Just high enough to break most of the bones in his body. Marcus watched him fall, watched him scream, watched him hit the alley dumpster with a crunch that echoed off the buildings.

Headly lay there, broken, breathing in short gasps, unable to move.

Marcus dropped from the window. Three stories. He landed in a crouch, concrete cracking slightly beneath his feet. He straightened, walking over to where Headly lay crumpled in the garbage.

The man's eyes tracked him. Terrified. In pain. Understanding, finally, what Marcus had become.

Marcus knelt beside him. Pulled out a marker from his pocket. Wrote four words across Headly's forehead:

**I DESERVE BETTER**

"That's what Shanice's movement says," Marcus told him. "The people fighting against cops like you. The people demanding justice. I'm giving them some."

He stood. Looked down at Headly's broken form.

"You'll live," Marcus said. "You'll tell everyone what happened here. And no one will believe you. Because how could Marcus Williams, five-foot-eleven, one-ninety pounds, throw a man out a third-story window? How could he survive a three-story drop? How could he do any of this?"

Marcus stepped back. "But you'll know. And Reynolds will know when I visit him. And everyone in that precinct will know that the consequences finally came due."

He walked away, Headly's whimpers fading behind him.

---

**Marcus's Apartment - Dawn**

Marcus sat on his couch, staring at his hands as sunrise painted the city gold.

He'd crossed a line tonight. Assault. Breaking and entering. Attempted murder, maybe, though Headly would live. All the things he'd spent eight years as a cop fighting against.

But Headly would live. Marcus had made sure of that. Just like he'd make sure Reynolds lived. And Hayes. And Morrison. And everyone else who'd helped murder Shanice and cover it up.

They'd live broken. Terrified. Marked. Examples.

His phone buzzed. Text from an unknown number.

*We need to talk. What you did tonight was noticed. -K.E.*

Kaiser Eziobi. The Nigerian billionaire who'd been emailing Marcus for weeks. Talking about Africa. About building something better. About using power responsibly.

Marcus deleted the message.

He wasn't interested in responsibility. He'd been responsible for eight years. He'd followed the rules. Trusted the system. Believed in the badge.

And Shanice was dead because of it.

No. Marcus was done with systems. Done with rules. Done with waiting for someone else to deliver justice.

He had a list now. Twenty-seven names. Everyone who'd participated in the machinery that protected Headly and Reynolds. Everyone who'd looked the other way. Everyone who'd chosen the blue wall over the truth.

He'd visit them all. One by one. Night by night.

Until they understood what Shanice had understood:

The system was broken.

And Marcus Williams was the consequence of that failure.

He stood, walked to his window, looked out at the waking city. Somewhere out there, Reynolds was getting the news about Headly. Somewhere, the precinct was scrambling. Somewhere, someone was starting to realize that the rules had changed.

Marcus smiled, and it was not a kind expression.

Let them come. Let them try to stop him.

He was faster than their bullets.

Harder than their walls.

And more ruthless than their lies.

The Stampede had begun.

## CHAPTER 7: RAGHAVAN REDDY (INDIA)
### "The Golden Warrior"

**Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh - Year 2, Month 5**

Colonel Raghavan Reddy stood at the banks of the Ganga and watched the river burn.

Not with fire. With light. The liquid metal that had bonded to his body during those three months of absence pulsed beneath his skin, responding to the ancient waters like a tuning fork to a bell. Gold and plastic, the scientists called it. A symbiotic alien substance that granted him flight, strength, durability beyond human measure.

They didn't understand what it truly was.

Neither did Raghavan, most days.

The sun hadn't risen yet, but already the ghats were filling with pilgrims. They came to bathe, to pray, to release the ashes of their dead into the holy river. The river that had carried the hopes and sins and sorrows of India for millennia.

The river that Establishment 24 had promised to save.

"Colonel." Major Gupta approached from behind, footsteps careful on the stone steps. "The survey team has the latest readings. Pollution levels are down another twelve percent. The Icchatam Ganga project is succeeding beyond projections."

Raghavan nodded, not turning. "And the cost?"

Gupta hesitated. Raghavan could hear it in the pause, in the way the younger man shifted his weight. "Seventeen LSW operatives hospitalized with exhaustion. Three in critical condition. Dr. Sharma says if we maintain this pace—"

"We maintain it." Raghavan's voice was flat. Final. "The Prime Minister promised the people a clean Ganga. We will deliver."

"Yes, sir."

Gupta left. Raghavan remained, watching the pre-dawn light paint the water silver. Somewhere beneath those waters, Establishment 24's filtration teams worked in shifts, using their various abilities to extract pollutants, heavy metals, industrial waste, human refuse. The detritus of a civilization that had loved this river while slowly killing it.

Just as he had loved Nitya while his duty slowly killed their marriage.

*Not now. Don't think of her now.*

But the thought came anyway, as it always did. Nitya. His wife. His partner for nineteen years. The woman who'd smiled when he got the promotion to Major, who'd held him when his father died, who'd begged him to take leave, to spend time with their daughter, to be present instead of always chasing the next mission.

"After this operation," he'd told her. "After we stabilize the Kashmir border."

The bus crash happened on a Tuesday. She'd been visiting her sister in Kerala. The driver fell asleep at the wheel. Forty-three people died. Nitya was number seventeen on the official casualty list.

Raghavan got the news during a briefing about Pakistani troop movements. He'd excused himself, walked to the bathroom, and thrown up. Then he'd washed his face, straightened his uniform, and returned to finish the briefing.

Because the mission came first. Always the mission.

Until the lights took him.

The liquid metal had bonded to him during those lost months. When he woke in a Mumbai alley, it moved with him, through him, *as* him. He could make it harder than diamond, sharper than any blade. Could shape it into wings and fly. Could coat himself in armor that shrugged off bullets and shaped charges.

The scientists studied him for weeks. The government classified him immediately. The Prime Minister himself had requested Raghavan's service.

"You are India's greatest weapon," the PM had said. "Lead Establishment 24. Make our nation proud."

So Raghavan had. He'd assembled the best LSW operatives India had produced. He'd overseen the infrastructure projects that brought power to villages, roads to mountains, hope to millions. He'd become the face of India's LSW program—the golden warrior who proved that enhanced humans could serve the greater good.

He'd done everything right.

And still felt nothing but the hollow ache where Nitya used to be.

The liquid metal rippled beneath his skin, responding to his thoughts. Wanting to manifest. To take form. To let him escape into action instead of sitting here drowning in memory.

Raghavan denied it. Control was everything. The metal responded to thought, to emotion, to will. If he let it run wild, if he gave in to what he felt—

*Grief. Rage. Guilt. The knowledge that you chose duty over her, over and over, until there was no more her to choose.*

"Colonel Reddy?"

A different voice. Younger. Female. Raghavan turned to find Asha standing on the ghat below him, her slight form wrapped in a shawl against the morning chill.

"Asha." He kept his voice neutral. "You're back."

"Three days ago." She climbed the steps to stand beside him, her eyes distant in that way they got when she was processing memories that hadn't happened yet. "You didn't ask me about my trip."

"I assume you'll tell me what I need to know."

Asha was Establishment 24's most closely guarded secret. A seventeen-year-old girl from Bangalore who could step forward in time. Not physically—her body remained in the present. But her consciousness could jump ahead, hours or days or weeks, experiencing possible futures before returning with knowledge of what might come to pass.

The military applications were obvious. The government kept her in a facility designed like a luxury hotel and called it protection. Raghavan called it what it was: a gilded cage.

"I went forward three weeks," Asha said quietly. "To see the Ganga project's completion."

"And?"

"We succeed. The river will be eighty-three percent cleaner. The people celebrate. The PM gives a speech praising Establishment 24. You stand beside him in your golden armor, and the world sees India's triumph."

Raghavan waited. There was always more.

"And two days after the celebration, Thug Birham attacks."

The name hung in the air like smoke. Thug Birham. Leader of the New Thuggee cult that had emerged in the chaos following the first abductions. A zealot who believed the Grays were demons, that LSWs were possessed, that India needed purification through blood.

His followers had killed forty-three people in Mumbai last month. Establishment 24 had stopped them, but barely.

"How many casualties?" Raghavan asked.

"I saw seventeen timelines." Asha's voice was small. Tired. "In the best one, we lose sixty-three civilians. In the worst... the entire stadium."

The completion ceremony was scheduled for Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. Capacity: 132,000.

"Did you see how we stop them?"

Asha turned to look at him, and in her eyes Raghavan saw something that chilled him more than any threat analysis. Pity.

"In the timelines where we stop them, you have to choose," she said. "The stadium or the Ganga teams. Thug Birham is smarter than we thought. He's coordinating two simultaneous attacks. If you defend the ceremony, his people poison the filtration teams and undo everything we've accomplished. If you protect the teams, he kills everyone in the stadium."

"That's impossible. We have contingencies, backup teams—"

"He has LSW soldiers too." Asha's voice was flat. Dead. "Three of them. Defectors from the Pakistan program. I saw their powers. Fire. Corrosion. Something that makes people's blood crystallize in their veins. Colonel, we're not prepared for this."

Raghavan's hands clenched. The liquid metal responded, coating his fingers in golden armor before he forced it back. Control. Always control.

"Which choice did I make?" he asked. "In the timelines you saw?"

"You protected the Ganga teams. Every time. You let the stadium burn because the project was more important than the lives of—"

"Enough."

The word came out harder than he intended. Asha flinched. Raghavan forced himself to breathe, to think, to not let the weight of this crush him.

"Thank you for the intelligence," he said. "I'll inform Major Gupta. We'll prepare."

"Colonel—"

"Dismissed, Asha."

She left. Raghavan stood alone on the ghat as the sun finally broke the horizon, painting the Ganga in shades of gold and red.

*Blood and metal,* he thought. *The story of my life.*

---

**Establishment 24 Headquarters - New Delhi - Later That Day**

The briefing room held twenty-three people. Every major operative in Establishment 24. Every enhanced soldier, every gifted sage, every impossible asset that India had brought into the fold.

Raghavan stood at the front, the holographic display behind him showing Thug Birham's known movements, his cult's structure, the seventeen timeline variations Asha had witnessed.

"Our intelligence indicates coordinated attacks in three weeks," he said, voice carrying to every corner of the room. "The target is both the Ganga completion ceremony and our filtration teams. The enemy has LSW assets. Pakistani defectors. Threat Level 4 or higher."

Major Gupta pulled up the dossiers. Fire manipulation. Molecular corrosion. Blood crystallization. Powers that could kill thousands if deployed in crowds.

"Sir." One of the operatives raised her hand. Lieutenant Kavya, telekinetic, Threat Level 3. "If we know the attack is coming, why proceed with the ceremony? Why not cancel, draw them out in a controlled environment?"

"Because the Prime Minister will not cancel." Raghavan's voice was iron. "This ceremony represents India's commitment to its people. To show weakness, to back down from terrorists, would undermine everything we've built."

"Even if people die?"

The question hung there. Raghavan met Kavya's eyes.

"People are already dying," he said. "Every day the Ganga remains polluted. Every day industrial waste poisons the water supply. Every day children drink contaminated water and develop cancer at age six. The ceremony isn't about celebration. It's about proving that we can solve these problems. That enhanced humans can serve humanity instead of destroying it."

He pulled up another image. The stadium. 132,000 seats.

"But I will not sacrifice innocents for optics. We will protect both targets. We will adapt. We will prepare for all seventeen timelines and create an eighteenth where we win without compromise."

Gupta cleared his throat. "Colonel, with respect, even our best analysis shows that's impossible. We don't have the resources to—"

"Then we find them." Raghavan's armor rippled beneath his skin, gold gleaming through his uniform. "Contact Kaiser Eziobi in Nigeria. He's been expanding his network across Africa. Perhaps his resources can supplement ours. Reach out to SPEAR—yes, I know they're American, but Todd Benchley owes me a favor from Dhaka. And activate Protocol Garuda."

Silence. Protocol Garuda was their emergency mobilization—calling in every LSW operative across India, regardless of their current assignment. It had never been fully activated.

"Sir," Gupta said carefully, "Protocol Garuda would expose our full capabilities to every intelligence service monitoring us. China, Pakistan, the Americans—"

"I don't care." Raghavan's voice was quiet, but it cut through every objection. "I will not choose between saving the river and saving lives. I will not stand at another funeral and wonder if I could have prevented it. I will not fail again."

The room went still. They all knew about Nitya. About the bus crash. About the mission that had taken Raghavan away from his wife on the day she needed him most.

"We have three weeks," he continued. "Use them. Prepare. Train. Rest when you can. Pray to whatever gods still listen. Because in three weeks, we face an enemy who wants to watch India burn."

He straightened, the armor manifesting fully now, coating him in liquid gold that shimmered in the briefing room's lights.

"And we're going to show them that India doesn't burn. It shines."

---

**Raghavan's Quarters - That Night**

The message from Kaiser Eziobi came at 11 PM.

*Received your request. Africa has its own challenges, but I respect what you're building. I can offer intelligence assets and limited LSW support. However, I need something in return. There's an American operative causing problems. Marcus Williams. Former Chicago police. Enhanced. Dangerous. He's heading to Lagos. If our paths cross, I may need Establishment 24's backing.*

Raghavan stared at the message. Marcus Williams. He'd read the reports. The cop who'd gone rogue. The vigilante they called Stampede. A man who'd decided that the system was too broken to save and that violence was the only answer.

A man not unlike Raghavan himself, in some ways. Except Raghavan had chosen to work within the system. To build instead of destroy.

Most days, he wasn't sure which approach was right.

He drafted a response. *I cannot commit Establishment 24 to your personal conflicts. But if Williams threatens civilians, we will respond. Focus on the intelligence. I need everything your networks have on Pakistani LSW defectors.*

Before he could send it, another message appeared. This one flagged urgent. Coded. From an asset in Kashmir.

*Major Pritam reporting. Intercepted Pakistani communications. They know about the ceremony. They're supporting Thug Birham. This isn't just a cult attack. It's a coordinated effort to destabilize India's LSW program. Be advised: they have a fourth asset. Unknown classification. Asha's timelines may be incomplete.*

Raghavan's blood went cold.

A fourth asset. Unknown classification. Which meant it was something new. Something Asha hadn't seen because it existed outside her timeline observations.

Something that could change everything.

He stood, walked to his window, looked out at New Delhi's glittering lights. Somewhere out there, in the darkness between stars, the Grays watched. Observing. Testing. Pushing humanity toward... what? Evolution? Extinction? Some alien purpose his merely human mind couldn't comprehend?

They'd taken him for three months. Changed him. Given him power.

But they'd taken Nitya forever. And no amount of power could bring her back.

The liquid metal responded to his grief, spreading across his skin like molten sorrow. He let it, for once. Let it coat him fully. Let it manifest the wings that could carry him above the city, above the pain, above the impossible choices that awaited him in three weeks.

He flew.

Not toward anything. Just away. Into the night sky, into the clouds, into the cold clean air where nothing could touch him.

Below, India sprawled—ancient and modern, sacred and profane, beautiful and broken. A nation of contradictions held together by hope and history and the thin thread of belief that tomorrow might be better than today.

Raghavan had sworn to protect it. To serve. To be the golden warrior who never faltered, never broke, never showed weakness.

But up here, alone with the stars and the memory of his wife's smile, he let himself break.

Just for a moment.

Just long enough to remember what he was fighting for.

Then he descended, golden armor gleaming in the moonlight, and returned to the war.

## CHAPTER 8: KARINE ABRAHAMIAN (ARMENIA)
### "Knowledge Without Wisdom"

**Yerevan, Armenia - Year 2, Month 7**

Karine Abrahamian woke up knowing how to build a weapon that could unmake the universe.

Not metaphorically. Not theoretically. She knew the exact specifications. The materials required. The assembly process. The fail-safes that would prevent the weapon from annihilating its creator along with the target. She knew it the way she knew how to breathe, how to blink, how to reach for the glass of water on her nightstand.

The knowledge sat in her mind like a tumor made of light.

She lay in her apartment's darkness, staring at the ceiling, her heart hammering against her ribs. This was the seventeenth morning she'd woken up knowing something she'd never studied. Yesterday it had been the complete genome of a species that wouldn't evolve for another million years. The day before, the mathematical proof of a theorem that would revolutionize quantum computing.

Before that: the cure for three separate cancers. The location of every submarine in the Black Sea. The private thoughts of the Russian president, transcribed in perfect detail from a meeting she'd never attended.

The knowledge kept coming. Unasked for. Unwanted. Impossible.

Ever since the lights had taken her.

Karine forced herself to sit up. Her studio apartment in Yerevan's Arabkir District was small, cramped, cheap. The kind of place you lived when you'd been expelled from university for plagiarism, when your family disowned you for the shame, when you worked three jobs just to afford rent and instant noodles.

The kind of place you hid when aliens abducted you for ninety-two days and returned you with knowledge that could change the world.

Or destroy it.

Her laptop sat on the desk across the room. Forty-seven browser tabs open. Research on nano-machine engineering. Molecular assembly. Self-replicating systems. Technologies she'd never studied but now understood with perfect clarity.

She'd spent the last three months teaching herself to filter it. To control the flow of information that wanted to pour through her like water through a broken dam. Some days she succeeded. Some days she woke up and the knowledge was gentle, useful. Mundane things. How to fix her neighbor's wifi. The optimal recipe for khachapuri. The weather patterns for next week.

But other days, she woke up knowing how to end civilization.

And that knowledge was worth money.

Karine's phone buzzed. Text from Viktor.

*We need to talk about the demonstration. Chinese delegation arrives next week. Are you ready?*

Viktor Ohanyan. Tech entrepreneur. Her only friend since the abduction. The only person who'd believed her when she said she could do the impossible.

The only person who'd asked her to prove it.

Karine stared at the message. Next week. The demonstration. The moment she'd either become rich beyond imagination or expose herself as a fraud.

Except she wasn't a fraud.

That was the problem.

---

**NuroNuro Labs - Industrial District - Later That Morning**

The laboratory was small. Three rooms in a converted warehouse. Viktor's startup money bought the equipment: electron microscopes, molecular assemblers, clean rooms, servers. All legal. All above board.

All designed to house Karine's impossible inventions.

"Show me," Viktor said, leaning against the workbench. He was thirty-two, handsome in that sharp way Armenian men got when they spent too much time in Moscow. Confidence and hunger in equal measure.

Karine pulled up the specifications on her tablet. NuroNuro. Neural Upload and Resource Optimization. A system of nanoscale machines that could interface with human neural tissue, creating direct brain-to-brain communication and skill sharing.

Viktor's eyes widened as he scrolled through the designs. "This is... Karine, if this works—"

"It works." She said it with the absolute certainty of someone who knew. "I tested it on mice last week. Two mice. One trained to navigate a maze, one not. After the NuroNuro connection, the untrained mouse ran the maze perfectly."

"Jesus Christ." Viktor looked up at her. "You understand what this means? If humans can share skills, knowledge, experiences directly—"

"Entire industries collapse. Education becomes obsolete. Expertise becomes transferable. Yes, I understand the implications."

Karine walked to the containment unit where the first human-scale NuroNuro batch was growing. Millions of microscopic machines, too small to see individually, multiplying in the nutrient bath like technological bacteria.

She'd designed them in four hours. Built them in three days. They were perfect.

And they terrified her.

"The Chinese delegation is from Huawei," Viktor said. "They've been looking for brain-computer interface technology for years. If we can demonstrate this successfully—"

"We'll be rich. You'll get your exit. I'll get my reputation back." Karine touched the glass of the containment unit. "And China will get the ability to optimize their entire workforce by sharing the skills of their best workers with everyone else."

Viktor's enthusiasm dimmed slightly. "You say that like it's a bad thing."

"It's not bad. It's not good. It's just... power." Karine turned to face him. "And power gets used, Viktor. You think China will stop at workplace optimization? Think they won't use this for military training? Interrogation? Thought control?"

"That's not our problem." Viktor's voice hardened. "We build the technology. How people use it—"

"Is exactly our problem!" Karine surprised herself with the vehemence. "I can create things, Viktor. Things that shouldn't exist. Things I don't even remember learning. But just because I *can* doesn't mean I *should*."

"You're having second thoughts."

"I'm having *all* the thoughts." She laughed, bitter and sharp. "That's the fucking problem. I wake up knowing things I wish I didn't. Like how to build weapons. How to crack encryption that protects billions of people. How to synthesize drugs that could cure diseases or start plagues. The knowledge doesn't come with instructions. It doesn't come with morality. It's just *there*."

Viktor was quiet for a long moment. Then: "What do you want to do?"

Karine looked at the NuroNuro batch. At the technology that could revolutionize human civilization or become another tool of oppression. At the choice she'd somehow ended up with despite never asking for it.

"I want to go back," she said quietly. "To before. When I was just a girl who plagiarized a paper because I was scared of failing. When the biggest problem in my life was my mother's disappointment. When I didn't know how to end the world."

"But you can't."

"No." Karine smiled, sad and sharp. "So I guess we go forward."

---

**Karine's Apartment - Three Days Later**

The Russian agents weren't subtle.

Karine spotted them from her window. Black sedan. Tinted windows. Parked across the street for three hours. Amateur surveillance meant to intimidate, not hide.

Moscow had noticed NuroNuro. Which meant someone in Viktor's circle had leaked. Which meant the Chinese weren't the only ones interested.

Karine's phone rang. Unknown number.

She answered.

"Miss Abrahamian." The voice was male, middle-aged, spoke Armenian with a Moscow accent. "My name is Dmitri Volkov. I represent certain interests in the Russian Federation. I believe we have much to discuss."

"I'm not interested in selling to Russia."

"Selling?" Volkov laughed. "My dear, we're not interested in buying. But we are very interested in ensuring that certain technologies don't fall into Chinese hands. Or American. Or anyone else's, for that matter."

Karine's blood went cold. "Is that a threat?"

"It's a reality. You possess knowledge that makes you valuable. Valuable things attract attention. Attention brings danger. I'm offering protection."

"In exchange for what?"

"Access. Consultation. The occasional project for the betterment of Russian security interests." His voice was smooth. Practiced. "Think of it as a partnership. You continue your work. We ensure no one interferes. Everyone wins."

"And if I refuse?"

"Then we can't guarantee your safety. Armenia is a small country, Miss Abrahamian. Far from Moscow's influence, you might think. But accidents happen. Labs catch fire. Researchers disappear. Such tragedies."

The line went dead.

Karine stood there, phone in hand, looking at the sedan across the street. She thought about running. Leaving Yerevan. Destroying the NuroNuro batch and disappearing.

But they'd find her. Russia. China. America. They all wanted what she could create. They'd hunt her to the ends of the earth because knowledge was power and she had knowledge that could shift the balance of the world.

Her laptop chimed. Email. Encrypted. From an address she didn't recognize.

She opened it.

*Miss Abrahamian. My name is Dr. Sarah Chen, representing private interests in Beijing. We understand you're facing pressure from various parties regarding your work. We can offer better terms than Russia. And better protection. The demonstration next week—we're prepared to make a very generous offer. One that ensures you maintain control of your research and your safety. Consider this carefully. Time is limited. -S.C.*

Karine stared at the message. Then at the sedan. Then at the NuroNuro specifications still open on her screen.

Two great powers bidding for her knowledge. Fighting over her mind. Treating her like property instead of a person.

She thought about her grandmother. About being expelled from Monk College in Berlin for plagiarism. About the shame that had followed her home to Armenia. About working three jobs to survive in this shoebox apartment.

About the night the lights took her and changed everything.

She'd wanted her life back. Wanted respect. Wanted to prove she was more than a cheater, more than a failure.

Careful what you wish for.

Her phone rang again. Different number. She answered.

"Miss Abrahamian, this is Colonel Raghavan Reddy, Establishment 24, India. I apologize for the intrusion, but our intelligence indicates you may be in danger. We have... experience with individuals who possess unique knowledge. If you need extraction or protection—"

Karine hung up.

India too. How many others? How long before America knocked? Before every intelligence agency in the world decided she was too dangerous to leave free?

She walked to her window. Looked out at Yerevan. The city where she'd grown up. Where she'd loved and lost and failed and learned. The city that barely noticed her existence until now.

The city she'd probably have to abandon.

Unless—

The thought crystallized. Dangerous. Desperate. Maybe brilliant.

What if she gave them nothing? What if she destroyed the NuroNuro batch, erased the research, made herself useless? They couldn't exploit knowledge she didn't share. They couldn't force her to create if she refused.

But they could make her disappear. They could lock her in a lab and extract the knowledge by force. Drugs. Torture. Whatever it took.

No. She needed leverage. Needed to make herself more valuable alive and free than captured and controlled.

Which meant she needed to build something they all wanted. Something so revolutionary that harming her would mean losing it forever.

Something impossible.

Karine sat at her laptop. Opened a new file. Let the knowledge flow.

And began to design something that would change the game entirely.

---

**NuroNuro Labs - Five Days Later**

The beta test went perfectly.

Ten volunteers. Handpicked by Viktor. All signed NDAs thick enough to choke on. All desperate enough for money to ignore the risks.

Karine administered the NuroNuro doses herself. Microscopic injections. The nano-machines crossed the blood-brain barrier in seventeen seconds. Established neural links in forty-three minutes.

Then the skill transfer began.

Viktor played piano. Concert-level expertise. Twenty years of practice. The nano-machines recorded his neural patterns and transmitted them to the other nine subjects.

When it was over, all ten could play Chopin's Nocturne in E-flat major perfectly.

From zero skill to concert level in under an hour.

The volunteers stared at their hands in wonder. Viktor played the recording for the Chinese delegation via encrypted video call. The representative—Dr. Chen herself—went pale.

"Impossible," she whispered.

"Reproducible," Karine corrected. "I can scale this. Imagine a world where expertise is transferable. Where a surgeon in Beijing can share their skills with every doctor in China overnight. Where engineers, soldiers, teachers, anyone—can distribute their knowledge instantly."

"How?" Dr. Chen's voice was sharp. "How is this possible?"

Karine smiled. Didn't answer. The how was her leverage. The thing they couldn't replicate without her.

"The demonstration is complete," Viktor said. "We're entertaining offers. China. Russia. India. America. Highest bidder gets exclusive rights."

Dr. Chen's eyes narrowed. "That's a dangerous game, Miss Abrahamian."

"So is abducting people and turning them into weapons," Karine shot back. "But here we are."

The call ended. Viktor turned to her, grinning like a wolf.

"We did it. We're going to be—"

"Hunted," Karine finished. "We're going to be hunted by everyone. You understand that, right? We just showed the world that we can transfer skills between brains. Do you know what militaries will do with that? What intelligence agencies? What corporations?"

Viktor's grin didn't fade. "We control the technology. We set the terms. And we get rich doing it."

Karine looked at the volunteers. Ten people who could now play piano like masters because she'd rewired their brains. Ten people who didn't understand that they were now living proof that humanity's fundamental limitations could be hacked.

That knowledge itself could become a commodity.

That she'd just opened Pandora's box and couldn't close it.

Outside, the Russian sedan was gone. Replaced by two different vehicles. Chinese plates. American diplomatic tags.

The auction had begun.

And Karine Abrahamian, failed art student from Yerevan, was the prize.

She thought about her grandmother. About the lights. About the knowledge that still poured into her mind every morning, unasked for, unstoppable.

About the weapon specifications she'd woken up knowing that morning. How to build something that could erase cities from existence without leaving radiation or evidence.

She'd filed that knowledge away. Locked it deep. Swore she'd never tell anyone.

But how long before someone forced her to remember?

How long before knowledge became the most dangerous thing in the world?

Karine looked at Viktor, at the volunteers, at the world that was about to tear itself apart fighting over her mind.

And wondered if she should have just stayed expelled.

## CHAPTER 9: PRESIDENT CARLOS MENDOZA (SPAIN)
### "The Beginning of Grief"

**Madrid, Spain - Year 2, Month 9**

The morning Elena Mendoza died began with breakfast and sunlight.

President Carlos Mendoza sat at the small table in the private quarters of Palacio de la Moncloa, watching his wife pour coffee with the same precise grace she'd shown for twenty-three years. Steam rose from the cup. Morning light painted her silver-streaked hair gold.

"You're staring," Elena said, not looking up.

"I'm appreciating."

"You're nervous about the NATO meeting." She set the carafe down, fixed him with that look that had seen through every political facade he'd ever attempted. "The Americans are pushing for more LSW integration. You think it's too fast."

Carlos smiled despite himself. "Are you reading my mind now? Is that your secret power?"

"My power is being married to you for two decades." Elena sat across from him, her own coffee steaming. "I can read every expression, every hesitation. You think the American LSW program is reckless. You think rushing Spain's integration will cause more problems than it solves."

She wasn't wrong. The American program—FIST and its governmental counterpart—had produced powerful operatives. But the cost in civil liberties, in oversight, in simple human dignity, troubled Carlos deeply. Spain's LSW initiative was smaller. More careful. Focused on volunteer integration and strict ethical guidelines.

The Americans thought Spain was being naive. Carlos thought America was being American.

"The meeting is just discussion," he said. "Nothing binding."

"Liar." Elena's smile was warm. "But I love you anyway. Now eat your tostada before it gets cold. I won't have you embarrass Spain by fainting from hunger in front of the German Chancellor."

Carlos ate. They talked about their daughter Sofia's upcoming graduation. About Elena's charity work with refugee resettlement. About the anniversary dinner she'd planned for next week—twenty-three years since she'd said yes to a junior deputy from Seville who'd promised to change Spain.

Mundane. Perfect. The kind of morning that reminded Carlos why he did this job. Why he endured the politics and compromise and exhaustion. Because somewhere, someone's spouse was pouring them coffee. Someone's child was graduating. Someone's life was continuing because the machinery of government functioned well enough to let them be happy.

Elena kissed him goodbye at 9:47 AM. She was heading to the Museo Reina Sofía for a board meeting. After that, lunch with her sister. Then home to plan the anniversary dinner.

"I love you," Carlos said at the door.

Elena paused, something flickering in her eyes. "I love you too. Always."

"Always," Carlos echoed.

She left. Carlos returned to his office. He had a cabinet meeting at 10:30 about agricultural subsidies. Then the NATO conference call. Then a briefing on the Turkish situation—tensions rising, as always.

Normal. Routine. The kind of day he'd experienced a thousand times.

The last normal day of his life.

---

**Cabinet Meeting - 10:30 AM**

Minister of Agriculture Luis Vega droned on about wheat production quotas. Carlos took notes, half-listening, his mind already on the NATO call. The Americans would push. The Germans would equivocate. The French would propose something clever that solved nothing.

And Spain would do what Spain always did: find the middle ground. The reasonable position. The choice that sacrificed boldness for stability.

Sometimes Carlos wondered if Spain's moderation was wisdom or just fear dressed up as pragmatism.

"Mr. President?" Vega was looking at him expectantly.

"My apologies. Could you repeat the question?"

Vega did. Carlos responded. The meeting continued. Outside the windows, Madrid basked in autumn sunshine.

At the Museo Reina Sofía, Elena Mendoza sat through presentations on next year's exhibition schedule. Picasso. Dalí. Modern Spanish masters. She took notes, asked questions, smiled at her fellow board members.

At 11:43 AM, she excused herself to use the restroom.

At 11:47 AM, three blocks away, Sandra—Jackal, hunter, bearer of the Ring—walked through Madrid's streets with death in her pocket and alien whispers in her mind.

The Ring had shown her the target. A Turkish LSW operative hiding in Madrid. Classified as Threat Level 3. Abilities: molecular bonding and disruption. Wanted by three governments for industrial espionage and sabotage. Worth 2.5 million euros to the syndicate that hired Sandra.

The Ring told her everything. Where he'd be. When. How to approach. The perfect angle for the shot.

It didn't tell her about the woman in the crossfire.

---

**Calle de Alcalá - 12:03 PM**

Elena emerged from the museum into the Madrid sunshine, phone to her ear, talking to her sister about restaurant reservations. She laughed at something Teresa said. The sound carried down the street, bright and alive.

Two blocks ahead, Sandra tracked her target. The Turkish operative—traveling under the name Mehmet Kaya—was browsing a bookstore. Normal behavior. Cover. He'd exit in forty seconds and walk northeast toward the metro. Sandra's position on the opposite rooftop gave her perfect line of sight.

The Ring whispered confirmations. Calculations. Wind speed. Bullet trajectory. Probability of success: 94.7%.

Sandra loaded the rifle. Custom build. Untraceable. The syndicate provided the best tools.

Elena said goodbye to Teresa. Ended the call. Decided to walk instead of catching a cab. The weather was too beautiful to waste. She'd cut through Plaza de Cibeles, maybe stop at that café Carlos liked for coffee.

Mehmet Kaya exited the bookstore. Exactly on time. The Ring was never wrong.

Sandra sighted. Breathed. Her finger found the trigger.

Elena turned the corner onto Calle de Alcalá. She was humming. Something from the radio. A song Sofia loved.

Mehmet Kaya walked into Sandra's crosshairs.

Elena walked into the space between them.

Sandra fired.

The bullet traveled at 2,800 feet per second. It covered the distance in 0.21 seconds. In that time, Elena Mendoza took three more steps, thinking about anniversary dinners and museum exhibitions and her husband's worried face over breakfast.

In that time, Sandra's enhanced reflexes registered the civilian in the path. Tried to adjust. Failed.

In that time, the Ring calculated the new trajectory and said nothing because algorithms don't feel guilt.

The bullet hit Elena Mendoza in the left side of her chest. Passed through her lung. Severed her aortic arch. Exited through her back and continued into Mehmet Kaya's shoulder.

Both fell. Only one would rise.

Sandra was gone before the screaming started. Protocol. Clean exit. The Ring showed her the route. Subway. Safe house. Next target.

But something in Sandra's chest twisted as she ran. Something the Ring couldn't optimize or calculate or explain away.

She'd killed the wrong person.

She'd killed someone who wasn't on anyone's list. Someone who was just walking. Just living. Just being in the wrong place when Sandra pulled the trigger.

The Ring whispered that acceptable losses were part of operations. That civilian casualties happened. That the primary target was wounded and would be eliminated by local assets.

Sandra kept running.

Behind her, emergency services descended on Calle de Alcalá. Paramedics. Police. Crowds of shocked Madrileños.

And Elena Mendoza, bleeding out on the sidewalk, her phone still clutched in her hand, screen cracked but displaying her last text to Carlos:

*Don't forget—anniversary dinner next week. I'm making your favorite. I love you.*

She died before the ambulance arrived.

---

**Presidential Office - 12:27 PM**

Carlos was reviewing his notes for the NATO call when his chief of staff burst in.

"Mr. President—"

One look at Miguel's face told Carlos everything. That expression. The one staffers learned. The one that meant bad news. The worst news.

"What happened?"

"There's been a shooting. Calle de Alcalá. Multiple casualties. Mr. President, one of them is—"

Carlos was already moving. "Where?"

"Hospital Universitario La Paz. She's in surgery. Sir, I have to tell you—"

"Get me there. Now."

The drive took twelve minutes. Carlos didn't remember any of it. Didn't remember the security protocols. The motorcade. The sirens. Just Miguel's voice, quiet and careful, explaining what they knew.

Shooting. Unidentified assailant. One target was a Turkish national. The other was—

"Is she alive?" Carlos interrupted.

"She was when the paramedics arrived. Sir, you need to prepare—"

The hospital was chaos. Press already gathering. Security locking down the entrances. Doctors in surgical scrubs hurrying through halls.

Someone guided Carlos to a private waiting room. Time became meaningless. A surgeon came. Said words like "trauma" and "blood loss" and "did everything we could."

Did everything.

Past tense.

Carlos heard himself say thank you. Heard himself ask to see her. Followed someone down a hallway that seemed to stretch forever.

The room was too white. Too clean. Too quiet.

Elena lay on the table, a sheet pulled to her shoulders. Her face was peaceful. She could have been sleeping except for the pallor, the stillness, the absolute absence of the woman who'd poured his coffee this morning.

Carlos stood there, looking at her, unable to process what he was seeing. This morning she'd kissed him goodbye. This morning she'd laughed. This morning she'd been *alive.*

"Sir." Miguel, at his elbow. "The security briefing. They have preliminary information on the shooter."

Carlos didn't care about the shooter. Didn't care about anything except the fact that Elena was gone and he'd said I love you but he hadn't meant it enough, hadn't shown it enough, had let work and duty and responsibility take time that should have been hers.

"The target was a Turkish LSW operative," Miguel continued. "Intelligence indicates he was hiding in Madrid. Your wife was... she was in the wrong place. Collateral damage from what appears to be a professional hit."

Collateral damage. Elena. His wife of twenty-three years. The mother of his child. The woman who'd made him better than he was. Reduced to collateral damage.

"The Turkish operative?" Carlos heard himself ask.

"Wounded but alive. In custody. We're coordinating with—"

"Release him."

Miguel blinked. "Sir?"

"The Turkish operative. The target. Release him."

"Mr. President, he's wanted for—"

"*Release him.*" Carlos's voice was ice. "And find out who hired the assassin. Find out who ordered this hit. Find out everyone involved."

"Sir, the investigation is ongoing. We don't have confirmation—"

Carlos turned to face his chief of staff. Miguel stepped back from whatever he saw in the President's eyes.

"My wife is dead because someone decided a Turkish spy was worth killing in the middle of Madrid. Because someone decided civilian casualties were acceptable. Because someone didn't care who got hurt as long as they completed their mission." Carlos's hands were shaking. He forced them still. "I want names. I want evidence. And I want everyone responsible for this to understand what they've done."

"Yes, Mr. President."

Miguel left. Carlos turned back to Elena. Reached out and took her hand. Still warm. Still her. Still impossible that she was gone.

"I'm sorry," he whispered. "I'm sorry I wasn't there. I'm sorry I couldn't protect you. I'm sorry for every missed dinner, every late night, every time I chose work over you."

Elena didn't answer. Would never answer again.

Carlos stood there, holding her hand, as the afternoon sun painted the white room gold.

Outside, Spanish intelligence was already mobilizing. Tracking the shooter. Following leads. Building the case. They would find Sandra eventually. Would trace the hit back to its source.

But that would take time. Days. Weeks. Maybe months.

Carlos didn't have that kind of patience anymore.

---

**Presidential Office - Two Days Later**

The briefing lasted twenty minutes. The intelligence chief laid out what they knew: Professional assassination. High-end weaponry. Clean exit. The target—Mehmet Kaya—was indeed a Turkish LSW operative wanted for industrial espionage. He'd been selling Spanish military secrets to the highest bidder.

"We believe the hit was ordered by a rival faction within Turkey," the chief said. "Possibly government-sanctioned. Possibly a private contractor. Our intel suggests—"

"It was a Jackal," someone interrupted. A woman Carlos didn't recognize. Late thirties. Sharp suit. CNI credentials. "We have partial surveillance footage. The shooter's methodology matches known Jackal patterns. Precision. No witnesses. Immediate extraction."

Jackals. The LSW hunters. The mercenaries who killed enhanced humans for blood samples, tissue, cerebral fluid. The predators that made powered individuals afraid to reveal themselves.

Carlos had read the reports. Had authorized limited cooperation with international efforts to regulate them. Had thought of it as someone else's problem.

Until one of them killed his wife.

"Do we have an ID on the Jackal?" he asked.

"Not yet, Mr. President. But we're working with FIST, SPEAR, and Interpol—"

"I want every resource we have dedicated to this. I want this Jackal found. I want the people who hired them found. I want everyone involved in my wife's murder found and brought to justice."

The room went quiet. They all heard it. The shift from professional concern to personal vendetta. The line Carlos was crossing.

"Mr. President," the CNI agent said carefully, "with respect, a full-scale manhunt for a Jackal will have international ramifications. These operations cross borders. Involve multiple governments. If Spain acts unilaterally—"

"I don't care." Carlos's voice was flat. Dead. "My wife was murdered because someone thought a Turkish spy was worth more than her life. Because someone decided Madrid was an acceptable hunting ground. Because someone believed they could kill with impunity."

He stood, hands on the table, looking at each person in the room.

"They were wrong. And I'm going to prove it."

---

**Private Quarters - That Night**

Sofia arrived from university. Twenty-two. Her mother's eyes. Her mother's strength. She collapsed into Carlos's arms and they held each other while the enormity of the loss crushed them both.

"What do we do?" Sofia asked, voice muffled against his shoulder.

"We survive," Carlos said. "And we make sure she didn't die for nothing."

Later, alone, Carlos stood at the window of his office and looked out at Madrid. The city glittered in the darkness, oblivious to his grief. Millions of lights. Millions of lives. All continuing as if the world hadn't ended.

His phone buzzed. Encrypted message from military intelligence.

*We have a lead on the Jackal. Possible sighting in Valencia. Coordinating with local assets.*

Carlos stared at the message. Thought about Elena's laugh. Her coffee. Her final text about anniversary dinner.

Thought about the Jackal who'd pulled the trigger. The Turkish operative who'd been the target. The government that had sanctioned the hit.

Thought about justice. About revenge. About the line between them.

He typed a response.

*Deploy all necessary resources. I want this person caught. I want answers.*

The message sent. Carlos set the phone down. Looked at the photo on his desk—him and Elena on their wedding day, young and stupid and so impossibly happy.

"I will make this right," he promised her. "Whatever it takes."

Outside, Spain slept. Unaware that its President had just declared a private war.

Unaware that Elena Mendoza's death would set in motion events that would reshape European politics.

Unaware that grief, given power and purpose, could be the most dangerous force in the world.

## CHAPTER 10: MOSES APIO (UGANDA)
### "The Lake Calls"

**Kampala, Uganda - Year 2, Month 11**

Moses Apio had never trusted water.

Growing up in Kampala, he'd seen what the rains could do. The floods that turned streets into rivers. The mud that swallowed houses. The diseases that spread when the sewers overflowed. Water was necessary. Essential. But it was also chaos waiting for an excuse.

So when Sam suggested a trip to Lake Victoria, Moses's first instinct was to refuse.

"Come on, man." Sam leaned against the workbench in their shared mechanic's bay, grinning that grin that had gotten them both in trouble more times than Moses could count. "We've been working nonstop for three months. The engines aren't going anywhere. One weekend. Fresh air. Swimming. Remember swimming?"

Moses wiped grease from his hands, looking at the Toyota engine they were rebuilding. Mr. Okello's truck. Due next Tuesday. The carburetor was giving them trouble, and the timing belt needed—

"Moses." Sam's voice turned serious. "When's the last time you did something that wasn't school or work or sleep? Actually, when's the last time you slept more than five hours?"

Moses didn't answer. Couldn't remember.

"Exactly." Sam clapped him on the shoulder. "Lake Victoria. This weekend. My cousin has a place. We'll fish. Relax. Maybe you'll stop looking like you're about to collapse."

"I'm fine."

"You're not fine. You're grinding yourself into dust." Sam's expression softened. "Look, I know you're sending money home. I know your family needs you. But you're no good to them dead, yeah? One weekend. Please."

Moses looked at his friend. At the genuine concern in his eyes. At the olive branch being offered.

"Okay," he said. "One weekend."

Sam's grin returned. "Brilliant! I'll tell my cousin. We leave Friday after class."

Moses nodded, turning back to the engine. But something in his chest twisted. Unease. Inexplicable. Like the moment before lightning strikes when the air goes still and charged.

He ignored it.

He shouldn't have.

---

**Lake Victoria - Friday Evening**

Sam's cousin lived in a small house near Entebbe, close enough to the lake that you could hear the water lapping at the shore. The sun was setting when they arrived, painting the lake in shades of orange and gold.

Moses stood on the dock, looking out at the vast expanse of water. Lake Victoria. The largest lake in Africa. The source of the Nile. Ancient and deep and full of secrets.

The unease was stronger now. A persistent itch at the back of his mind. Like being watched. Like standing on the edge of a cliff and feeling the pull of the drop.

"Beautiful, right?" Sam appeared beside him, two beers in hand. He offered one to Moses.

"Yeah." Moses took the beer but didn't drink. "Beautiful."

They spent the evening with Sam's cousin and his family. Dinner. Stories. Laughter. Normal things. Good things. Moses should have relaxed. Should have felt the tension leaving his shoulders, the exhaustion lifting.

Instead, the unease grew.

That night, he dreamed.

Not dreams. Visions.

He stood at the lake's edge in darkness. The water glowed. Not with moonlight. With something underneath. Something moving. Something vast and ancient and aware.

The water called to him. Whispered in languages he didn't know. Promised things he couldn't understand. Showed him images that made no sense—metal that flowed like liquid, voices that spoke in his mind, power that could reshape reality.

Moses woke in a cold sweat, heart hammering. Sam snored in the next bed. The room was dark and still and normal.

But the unease remained.

---

**The Lake - Saturday Morning**

Sam wanted to swim. Moses made excuses. Headache. Tired. Not feeling it. Sam gave him worried looks but didn't push.

Moses sat on the dock while the others splashed and laughed in the shallows. The water was calm. Clear. Harmless.

But he couldn't shake the feeling that something was watching him from below.

"You're being paranoid," he muttered to himself. "It's just a lake."

Except it wasn't just a lake. It was Lake Victoria. And Lake Victoria had stories. Legends. The old women in the markets talked about spirits in the deep. About fishermen who went out and never returned. About lights under the water that moved with purpose.

Superstition, Moses had always thought. Old beliefs that science had disproven.

But he'd also seen Johnny Rain on television. The musician-turned-politician who'd lost the election but won something else. Who spoke about aliens and abductions and coming changes. Who claimed the Grays were real and preparing humanity for war.

Moses had dismissed it as political theater. Publicity. Maybe Rain had been abducted—people disappeared all the time. Maybe he'd been enhanced. But the rest? Aliens preparing for war? Humanity being transformed into weapons?

Too much. Too crazy.

Except Moses kept having the dreams.

And the water kept calling.

---

**Saturday Night**

Moses woke at 3 AM to find himself standing at the dock in his boxers.

He had no memory of getting up. No memory of leaving the house. No memory of walking through the dark to the water's edge.

But here he was, toes touching the lake, the water lapping at his feet like a living thing.

And below the surface, the lights.

Moses's breath caught. They weren't reflections. Weren't stars. Weren't anything natural. They moved with purpose. Circled. Danced. A dozen points of cold blue light beneath the black water.

He should run. Should scream. Should do anything except stand here watching the impossible.

But he couldn't move.

The lights rose. Closer. Closer. Breaking the surface.

Not lights. Machines. Spherical. Metallic. Covered in symbols that hurt to look at directly.

The Grays.

Moses had seen the reports. The grainy footage. The testimony of people who claimed they'd been taken. He'd thought it was mass hysteria. Shared delusion.

But here they were. Real. Undeniable.

One of the spheres approached the dock. Hovered at eye level. Moses stared at his own reflection in its surface—a scared kid from Kampala who fixed engines and sent money home and had never done anything important in his entire life.

The sphere opened.

Light poured out. Not harsh. Gentle. Warm. Inviting.

And from within that light, something extended. A tendril. Metallic. Fluid. Moving like it was alive.

It held something.

A bracelet.

Indonesian design. Copper and silver. Inlaid with stones that gleamed with inner light. Beautiful. Ancient. Impossible.

The tendril offered it to Moses.

He should refuse. Should run. Should do anything except reach out.

But his hand moved on its own. Touched the bracelet.

It was warm.

The sphere's light intensified. Moses tried to pull back. Couldn't. The light wrapped around him like water, pulling him forward, pulling him in—

---

**Unknown Location - Unknown Time**

Moses woke slowly.

He lay on a surface that wasn't quite solid. Wasn't quite liquid. Something in between that adjusted to his body temperature and held him suspended.

The room around him was wrong. Angles that didn't match. Walls that seemed to fold in on themselves. Light that came from everywhere and nowhere.

And the beings.

They weren't small gray men like the movies showed. They were... more. Shifting. Sometimes humanoid. Sometimes geometric. Sometimes just patterns of light and shadow that implied form without having it.

One approached. Moses wanted to scream. Wanted to fight. But his body wouldn't respond.

The being reached out. Not with hands. With intent. And Moses felt his mind opening like a book.

They sifted through his memories. His dreams. His fears. His hopes for his family, his determination to succeed at mechanic school, his friendship with Sam, his quiet wish that maybe someday he'd be more than just another poor kid from Kampala who fixed engines.

The being found something in those memories. Something they were looking for.

*Worthy,* they said. Not in words. In knowledge inserted directly into Moses's mind.

Then they showed him what they wanted. What they needed. What he could become.

The Atlas Protocol. One third of a weapon created by a civilization that died before Earth had multicellular life. A tool of impossible power. A burden no human should carry.

They were giving it to him.

Moses tried to refuse. Tried to explain that he was nobody. Just a student. Just a mechanic. Just a kid who barely understood the engines he fixed, let alone alien technology that could reshape matter itself.

*That is why you were chosen,* the beings said. *Power given to those who seek it becomes tyranny. Power given to those who do not corrupts slowly. You will do neither. You will serve.*

The bracelet appeared in front of him. Floating. Waiting.

Moses looked at it. At the beings. At the impossible choice being offered.

Then he thought about his family. About Sam. About Johnny Rain and his promises of a better Uganda. About all the people who struggled and suffered while others used power for themselves.

About what he could do with a weapon like this.

About what he shouldn't.

He reached out.

The bracelet slid onto his wrist.

And the world ended.

**Lake Victoria - Sunday Morning**

Sam found Moses at dawn, lying on the dock, soaking wet, the Indonesian bracelet gleaming on his left wrist.

"Moses! Jesus Christ, what happened? Were you in the water? Are you okay?"

Moses sat up slowly. His head pounded. His body ached like he'd been taken apart and reassembled wrong. But he was alive.

He looked at the bracelet. At Sam's terrified face. At the lake, calm and innocent in the morning light.

"I fell in," Moses heard himself say. "Must have been sleepwalking. I'm okay."

It was a lie. Sam knew it was a lie. But what was the truth? That Moses had been abducted by alien machines? That they'd given him a weapon from a dead civilization? That something was living inside the bracelet, waiting to manifest?

That would sound insane.

Even though it was true.

Sam helped him back to the house. Made him tea. Watched him with worried eyes.

Moses touched the bracelet. It was warm. And in the back of his mind, just at the edge of hearing, a voice whispered.

*Hello, Moses Apio. I am the Atlas Protocol. We have work to do.*

Moses closed his eyes.

"Yeah," he whispered back. "I'm starting to realize that."

**Epilogue - Two Weeks Later**

Moses returned to school. Tried to pretend everything was normal. Tried to focus on engines and homework and sending money home.

But the Atlas Protocol whispered. Showed him things. Possibilities. Applications of its power that Moses barely understood.

*You could reshape that engine with a thought. Could make it more efficient. More powerful.*

"I don't want to."

*You could protect your classmates. The gangs that threatened you—you could stop them.*

"I'm not a fighter."

*You could change Uganda. Help Johnny Rain build the country he dreams of.*

"I'm a mechanic student. I fix engines. That's all."

*You are more than that now. We are more than that.*

Moses sat in his dorm room, staring at the bracelet. At the liquid metal that pulsed beneath its surface. At the power he'd never asked for and didn't know how to use.

His phone buzzed. Text from an unknown number.

*Moses Apio. Your selection by the Atlas Protocol has been noted. The Hand of Uganda would like to speak with you regarding mandatory registration of LSW assets. Please report to the following address within 48 hours.*

The address was a government building in Kampala's center. Official. Mandatory. Not a request.

Moses's hands shook. The government knew. Somehow, they knew.

The Atlas Protocol pulsed.

*They always know, partner. The question is: what will you tell them?*

Moses looked at his phone. At the bracelet. At the window where Kampala sprawled in the evening light.

At the future rushing toward him like a flood he couldn't stop.

"I don't know," he whispered.

The Atlas Protocol didn't answer.

But in the liquid metal's depths, Moses thought he saw something move. Something vast. Something that had been sleeping for millennia and was finally waking up.

Something that would change everything.
