Episode 1

1 - 2
The first light of dawn broke through the horizon, casting a warm glow on the mud-and-watt le home in Mbarara, Uganda. Mosses Apio stepped out from the small doorway, ducking to avoid the low lintel. He straightened up, his mother following closely behind him. The worn-out bag hanging over his shoulder, like a badge of honor, symbolized the beginning of his journey towards a brighter future.
"Mosses," she began, her voice barely above a whisper, "you know we've put everything into this. All our savings. Everything. This is your chance to make a better life for yourself. For us."
Mosses felt a lump in his throat. He knew how much his mother had sacrificed for him, how hard she had worked to afford his tuition. But hearing her say it out loud made it all the more real.
"I know, Mama," he replied, squeezing her hand. "I won't let you down. I promise."
"Remember, my son, always make us proud," his mother said, her voice cracking as she held back tears.
"Ekisa kyange, Mama. I will do my best," Mosses replied, determination etched on his youthful face. His heart swelled with gratitude for his mother's tireless work that had made this opportunity possible.
As they walked to the bus stop, Mosses couldn't help but feel both excitement and nervousness. The prospect of attending the distinguished Driving & Mechanic Training School in Kampala both thrilled and terrified him. It was a chance to acquire job skills that could change their lives forever, lifting them from the depths of poverty. But it also meant leaving the comfort of his home and venturing into an unknown world.
"Kampala is very different from Mbarara," his mother warned, sensing her son's apprehension. "You're stronger than you think, Mosses. I believe in you."
"Webale nnyo, Mama," Mosses whispered, his eyes welling up with emotion. He took a deep breath and focused his thoughts on the task at hand. While he cherished the memories of his childhood spent in the tranquil village, he knew that the bustling city offered opportunities that could not be found here.
"Be kind to others, work hard, and never forget where you come from," his mother continued, her brown eyes shining with hope and pride. "You carry the dreams of our family with you."
"Jangu nno, Mama. I promise to make you proud," Mosses said firmly, his voice filled with resolve. He knew that the journey ahead would be challenging, but he also recognized that the sacrifices made by his mother and himself would eventually bear fruit.
Mosses knew that his mother had made many sacrifices so he could this mechanics school. He would not let her down
As they reached the bus stop, Mosses took one last look at his humble village, now bathed in the golden light of the rising sun. The worn-out bag on his shoulder felt heavier than ever, as if it carried not just his belongings but also the weight of his dreams and his mother's aspirations. Mosses sat with his mother, trembling with anticipation, as he prepared to board the bus for Kampala and start the greatest journey of his life.

Mosses clutched his worn-out bag, taking in the sight of his mother's tear-streaked face. He knew that saying goodbye would be difficult, but he hadn't anticipated the depth of emotion that welled up within him as they stood at the bus stop. The sun climbed higher in the sky, gradually bathing them both in its warmth as they shared their last moments together.
"Maama," Mosses said gently, looking into her eyes. "Gyebale ko." He bowed slightly, expressing gratitude for all she had done for him. The traditional greeting felt heavy with meaning now, and he could see the pride mingling with sadness in his mother's eyes.
"Webale nnyo, my son," she replied softly, reaching out to touch his cheek. "You have been my strength, and your hard work has brought us to this moment. I have made many sacrifices for you, but it is only because I believe in your future."
Mosses swallowed hard, feeling the weight of her words. "I will not let you down, Maama. I am determined to succeed at the Driving & Mechanic Training School and create a better life for both of us and I will not let anything stop me."
"Remember, Mosses," his mother insisted, her voice wavering with emotion. "Remember, success doesn't come easy. Keep your eyes on the prize and don't forget where you came from."
"Yewange, Maama," Mosses promised, nodding solemnly. As the bus pulled up, he turned to face her, his heart pounding with a mixture of sadness and anticipation. "It is time for me to go."
"Go well, my son," she whispered, pulling him into an embrace. "And remember, I will always be here, waiting for your return."
With one last look at his mother, Mosses stepped onto the bus, joining other young students who carried similar dreams and aspirations in their hearts. As they took their seats, the bus's engine roared to life, and the faint melody of Ugandan music floated through the air.
"Enkya, enkya," Mosses murmured to himself, the familiar phrase for "tomorrow" filling him with determination. He gazed out the window, watching as his mother grew smaller in the distance, her figure illuminated by the golden rays of the morning sun. "Kampala, I am coming for you." he spoke to himself.
5 - 6
"Hey, you're from Mbarara, right?" a voice beside him asked, breaking his reverie. Mosses turned to see a young man around his age, dressed in a simple cotton shirt and trousers.
"Yye, I am," Mosses replied, offering a small smile. "My name is Mosses."
"Nice to meet you, Mosses. I'm Ali. This journey will be an adventure for both of us, won't it?" Ali said, extending his hand in greeting.
"Yye, it surely will be," Mosses agreed, shaking Ali's hand firmly. He glanced at the other students on the bus, their faces reflecting various expressions of excitement, anticipation, and hope.
As the engine hummed beneath them, the bus traversed the red clay roads winding through lush green landscapes that seemed to stretch endlessly before them. Mosses listened to the excited chatter of the other passengers – stories intertwined with dreams of better futures, fueled by the opportunities awaiting them in Kampala.
"Have you ever been to Kampala before?" Ali asked, leaning towards Mosses.
"Never. It's my first time leaving Mbarara," Mosses admitted, feeling a surge of nervousness at the thought of navigating such a foreign environment.
"Me too. But we'll learn together, won't we?" Ali said, his eyes full of determination.
"Yye, we will," Mosses agreed, finding comfort in Ali's excitement. "My mother always says that with hard work and determination, anything is possible."
"We'll make our families proud, Mosses." Ali said.
"Yye, we will," Mosses echoed, feeling his resolve strengthen with each passing mile. The landscape outside shifted as they traveled deeper into the heart of Uganda, the vibrant green hues of the countryside giving way to the bustling energy of the city.
As they approached Kampala, Johnny Rain's infectious single, "Sun of the Soil" blared from the bus's radio. Mosses couldn't help but tap his foot in time with the song's pulsating rhythms, his heartbeat syncing with its infectious energy.
"Did you know Johnny Rain might be running for District Governor?" Ali asked, pointing to the bus speakers his eyes shining with anticipation.
"Oh?" Mosses replied, unfamiliar with the Ugandan superstar. His gaze fixed on the horizon, where the skyline of Kampala emerged like a promise of a brighter future.
"He's got a lot of fans, his music really speaks to people," Ali continued, his voice filled with admiration.
7 - 8
The bus pulled into the bustling heart of Kampala, and Mosses was immediately struck by the stark contrast to his tranquil village. The city teemed with life, its streets pulsating like a living, breathing entity. Buildings towered overhead, casting long shadows on the throngs of people below. Vendors hawked their wares in colorful markets while minibus taxis honked impatiently, weaving through traffic like skilled dancers. It was an overwhelming symphony of sights, sounds, and smells that both excited and intimidated him.
"Webale kujja," Ali said with a grin as they exited the bus, thanking the driver for bringing them. Mosses echoed the sentiment, his heart pounding in anticipation. This was where he believed his future awaited, and he was eager to grasp it with both hands.
As they navigated the crowded streets, Mosses couldn't help but the strong aroma of baking bread and roasting meats.
The air was ripe with the smoky scent of grilled meat, cooked over open flames. There were so many varieties of meat and rice, each one more appetizing than the next: Kyeba, Kanda, and Tofu with its spicy sauce.
He marveled at the vibrancy of the city of Kampala, its energy was invigorating.
"Here we are," Ali announced, pointing to a modest building nestled between larger structures. A sign bearing the words "Driving & Mechanic Training School" hung above the entrance, beckoning them inside.
"Kale," Mosses murmured, taking a deep breath to steady his nerves before stepping through the gates.
The industrious environment within the school was immediately apparent. Eager students huddled over engines, their hands slick with grease as watchful instructors guided their movements. The hum of machinery filled the air, punctuated by the occasional clanging of tools against metal. It was the sound of progress, a testament to the hard work and determination that fueled the school's success.
"Let's get settled in," Ali suggested, gesturing toward a group of other newcomers gathered near the entrance. As they joined their fellow students, they introduced themselves to one another, Mosses couldn't help but be struck by the diversity among them. His fellow students hailed from various corners of Uganda, their backgrounds as varied as the colors of the rainbow. Yet, despite their differences, they were united by a common goal: to make the most of this opportunity and create a better life for themselves and their loved ones.
9 - 10
As the class bell rang Mosses could feel the buzz of excitement in the air as he scanned the room for an empty seat.
"Excuse me," a deep voice cut through the cacophony of greetings and chatter. "I am Mr. Okello, the head instructor." A tall man with graying hair and kind eyes stepped onto the stage, his presence commanding the attention of everyone present. "Gyebale ko nnyabo ne ssebo," he greeted them warmly in Luganda, bowing slightly in their direction, before switching to English. "Welcome to our Driving & Mechanic Training School. We are honored to have you all here."
Mosses watched intently as Mr. Okello addressed the students. There was something about the way he spoke that demanded respect and admiration. As the head instructor continued to speak, his words seemed to envelop Mosses in a blanket of reassurance.
"Welcome, everyone," he said in a deep, reassuring voice. "You have all come here to learn and grow, to build a brighter future for yourselves and your families. This school will provide you with the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed, but it is up to each of you to put in the hard work and dedication required. Follow the rules, respect your peers and instructors, and never forget the reason you are here."
He paused for a moment before continuing. "One important rule to remember is not to leave the school at night. It is for your own safety and the security of the institution. Now, let us embark on this journey together. And if you do not remember anything that I have said here today remember this, focus on your training and I promise you, success will follow."
The conviction in Mr. Okello's words stirred something deep within Mosses, filling him with a newfound sense of determination. He knew that the road ahead would be challenging, but he also felt confident that with hard work, perseverance, and the support of the school, he could achieve great things.
"Mr. Okello," Mosses called out as the assembly began to disperse. The head instructor turned, a smile spreading across his face as he recognized the young man from Mbarara.
"Ah, Mosses Apio! I've heard a lot about you already," Mr. Okello said warmly, extending a firm handshake. "I am looking forward to working with you."
"Thank you, sir," Mosses replied, feeling a sense of pride at Mr. Okello's recognition. "I am eager to learn and work hard. But first I wanted to ask a question."
"Of course, ask away," Mr. Okello replied, his eyes encouraging.
"I understand the rule about not leaving the school at night," Mosses began tentatively. "But what if there is an emergency or a family crisis? Is there any way we can leave for a short time?"
Mr. Okello's expression grew serious as he considered the question. "Mosses, if anything unexpected happens, let us know right away. We'll do all we can to help and make sure you're okay, but it's not safe out here at night. If there is ever an emergency or crisis, please alert the school personnel fast," his words becoming gentler. "We will make every attempt to assist you and guarantee your safety, but the gang controls the streets of this area after sunset, so it's important that you don't go off-campus without permission."
Mosses nodded, grateful for the reassurance. He had no intention of breaking any rules or jeopardizing his safety, but it was comforting to know that there was a support system in place should he ever need to hurry home to see his return to his mother.
11 - 11
As Mosses stepped through the gates of the Driving & Mechanic Training School, the clang of tools, the hum of engines, and the excited chatter of fellow students filled the air. He could feel the energy vibrating all around him, igniting his own anticipation for the challenges and opportunities that awaited him.
"Welcome, my brother!" called a friendly voice from behind him. Mosses turned to see a tall young man with a warm smile approaching. "I am Sam," he said, extending his hand. "You must be new here."
"Webale ko, Sam," Mosses replied, shaking the outstretched hand gratefully. "Yes, I am. My name is Mosses Apio. I just arrived from Mbarara."
"Ah, you've come a long way then," Sam remarked, giving him a knowing nod. "Well, let me show you around. This place can be a bit overwhelming at first."
As they walked through the busy campus, Mosses found himself awestruck by the variety of machinery and vehicles, some of which he had only seen in pictures. His heart raced as he imagined working on them, mastering the skills that would ultimately change his life.
"Over there is where we practice our driving," Sam explained, pointing towards an open field lined with cones. "And that building houses our classrooms and workshops. Trust me, you'll spend a lot of time in there."
"Thank you for showing me around, Sam," Mosses said earnestly. "I'm both nervous and excited to start this journey."
"Don't fight it, Mosses," Sam responded, placing a reassuring hand on his shoulder. "It means you're alive and ready for change."
As they entered the workshop, Mosses took a moment to absorb the scene before him. Students were hunched over engines, their hands expertly maneuvering wrenches and spanners, while instructors watched closely, offering guidance and encouragement.
"Remember what Mr. Okello said," Mosses thought to himself, his eyes fixed on the flurry of activity around him. "We are all here to support you."
And with that, Mosses Apio fully immersed himself in the world of the Driving & Mechanic Training School, the head instructor's words echoing in his mind as he faced each new challenge and opportunity with renewed determination.
Mosses Apio took a deep breath as he fully immersed himself in the world of the Driving & Mechanic Training School. The head instructor's instructions echoed through his mind, giving him renewed energy and determination with every challenge and opportunity he faced. Mosses wasn't just learning; he was growing. 



Episode 2
1 - 2

Mosses sat on the edge of his bed in the small room he shared with two other students, his head in his hands. The sound of car horns, shouting vendors, and blaring music from the street below felt like a constant assault on his senses. He longed for the quiet of his village, where the only sounds were the gentle rustling of leaves and the distant lowing of cattle.

"Hey, Mosses," Sam called out as he entered the room, followed by Ali, their faces stretched into warm smiles. They had noticed how lost their friend seemed amidst the chaos of Kampala.

"Kale, bro!" Mosses greeted them, trying to sound enthusiastic. "How was your day?"

"Busy," Ali replied, plopping down onto his own bed. "But we managed to finish that engine repair we've been working on."

"Good job, Ali," Mosses said, genuinely impressed by his friend's determination.

"Come on, Mosses. Let's go grab some rolex from that vendor near the school gate," Sam suggested, hoping to help Mosses feel more comfortable in their new environment.

"Rolex? Like the watch? You think I have shillings to to spend of such things?" Mosses asked, perplexed.

Sam chuckled. "No, it's a popular street food. Its everywhere in Kampala, its made of eggs and vegetables rolled in a chapati. Trust me, it's delicious."

"Sure, why not?" Mosses agreed, getting up from his bed. The trio set out together, weaving their way through the crowded streets.

As they walked, Sam shared stories of his own experiences adjusting to city life, despite his privileged upbringing. His charisma and honesty put Mosses at ease, and soon the three friends were laughing together, sharing their dreams and aspirations.

"Every day will get easier, Mosses," Ali assured him, his eyes filled with a tenacity that seemed to defy the challenges they faced. "We're all in this together, and we'll help each other navigate this city."

Mosses nodded, feeling a newfound sense of comfort with Sam and Ali. They might all come from different backgrounds, but their shared interest in mechanics had brought them together. They were smart and tough.  With friends like these, he thought, perhaps he could face the challenges of city life head-on.

3 - 4

The sun hung low in the sky, casting a warm, orange glow across the bustling city of Kampala. The streets were alive with the sounds of laughter and friendly banter, as well as the hum of engines and honking horns from the ever-present traffic. Amidst it all, Mosses walked alongside Sam and Ali, the three friends weaving their way through the crowd.

"Kampala is like a living, breathing entity," Sam said, gesturing towards the busy street corner ahead of them. "It's always changing, always adapting."

"Within its chaos lies a certain beauty," Ali added, his eyes scanning the vibrant market stalls as they passed by.

Mosses nodded, taking in the sights, sounds, and smells of the city that was slowly becoming his new home. He couldn't help but feel both exhilarated and overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of it all.

As they rounded the corner, the trio came to a sudden halt. On the wall before them stood a striking piece of graffiti: an image of Jonny Rain, a popular Ugandan musician known for his political activism, accompanied by the words, "We stand with Jonny" in bold, colorful letters.

"Wow," Mosses murmured, staring at the artwork in awe.

"Jonny Rain, huh?" Sam remarked, stepping closer to examine the graffiti. "He's been making headlines lately."

"Who is he?" Mosses asked curiously, noticing the passion and intensity etched into the painted face on the wall.

"Jonny Rain is a musician who uses his platform to speak out against the government," Sam explained, his eyes narrowing as he recalled recent events. "He's become something of a symbol for change here in Uganda."

"Recently, he released a cryptic message on social media that stirred up quite a bit of controversy," Ali chimed in, a note of admiration in his voice. "Some people are calling it a call to action against the government."

Mosses' eyes widened as he considered the implications of such a bold statement in their politically charged climate.

"Jonny Rain is brave, there's no denying that," Sam continued, his gaze lingering on the graffiti. "But with that bravery comes risk. There are those who would do anything to silence voices like his."

"Doesn't that scare you?" Mosses asked, his heart pounding at the thought of the potential dangers lurking within the city.

"Of course it does," Ali admitted, his expression growing somber. "But we can't let fear control our lives. Jonny Rain's message has resonated with so many people because they're tired of living in fear. They want change."

"President Mugisha has been in in office since my grandfather was nearly my age," Sam added, placing a reassuring hand on Mosses' shoulder, "I like his songs, but I'm not so sure about Johnny Rain."

As they continued their walk through the city, Mosses couldn't help but feel inspired by the courage and determination displayed not only by Jonny Rain but also by his friends, Sam and Ali. As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting shadows across the graffiti-laden wall, Mosses knew deep down that, despite the uncertainties of life in Kampala, he was exactly where he needed to be.

5 - 6

Five - Six. Car horns, street vendors, and lively music filled the air as Mosses, Sam, and Ali walked along the bustling Kampala streets. Thinking about the graffiti they had just seen, Mosses felt a knot forming in his stomach, the city seemed alive with both promise and danger.

"Jonny Rain's message," Mosses asked, "does he promise things that might be different from President Mugisha's rule?"

"Maybe," Sam returned thoughtfully, "See Rain has been very vocal about the accusations against Mugisha, claiming the theft of billions of shillings  and a rigging the vote in favor of his party," Sam began, his tone thoughtful.  "He doesn’t stop at barking, though. Rain talks of bettering our health services, of providing a solid education system, and opening more job slots for every Ugandan. There was this snap he put up on social media, and from that moment I felt I could trust his talk. Let's not kid though, change can swing a hefty hammer. But if you spot it before it's mid-air, you've got a fighting chance. Every time."

"Is that a Johnny Rain lyric? Mosses asked.

Sam chuckled, shaking his head, "No, mate, that’s not a Jonny Rain lyric. Just my own thoughts, inspired by the situations we've been seeing. But, who knows, maybe I should consider a career in songwriting, eh?"

They laughed together.

Ali nodded as they approached a roadside vendor, used the traditional Acholi greeting of "Agwoyo" and purchased three cobs of roasted maize. "Thank you," he said, passing a corn cob to Mosses and Sam before diving back into the conversation. "Rain is tapping into something potent and honest. The people crave change. They're willing to face the storms that it might bring."

"That's exactly what worries me," injected Mosses, biting into the roasted maize, "I remember seeing President Mugisha as a child. He seemed...charismatic, electrifying even. Met him once, shook his sturdy hands. And look where we are now. What if Rain turns out to be another Olufu?"

"Olufu!?!" Sam laughed, swallowing a piece of corn, "You didn't know who he was, now you are accuring him of being a dictator? I've met Rain myself. He seems genuine enough. But, you're right, only time would truly tell."

"I've always been a fan of Rain," Ali confessed, chewing thoughtfully, "His lyrics have always been about equality, about justice. Maybe he just might be the change we need."

Mosses mulled over their words as they walked on, the endless hustle and bustle of the city echoing their lively conversation. The thought of someone like Johnny Rain, a musician with a rebellious streak and a heart for the public, coming into power intrigued him. In a strange way, it ignited hope within him.

"Johnny's music, his messages...there's a truth to them, I cannot deny," Mosses finally conceded, "I just hope that, if he does step into power, these truths wouldn’t ebb away."

"Same here," Ali joined in, "Different as they may be, I believe both Rain and Mugisha are catalysts—they reflect the public's angst, hope, and desire for change."

As they turned the corner, still discussing the implications of Jonny Rain's message, a commotion caught their attention. In a narrow alley near the graffiti-covered wall, a group of menacing-looking young men surrounded a lone figure, their faces contorted with rage.

"Those guys…" Sam whispered urgently, "they're B13 gang members. This doesn't look good."

"Guys, let's get out of here," Mosses urged, his voice trembling. But curiosity held them in place, like moths drawn to a flame.

The gang members began to brutally assault the victim, who wore a t-shirt emblazoned with Jonny Rain's image. As the helpless man cried out, Ali clenched his fists, torn between the urge to intervene and the instinct to protect himself and his friends.

"Look, there!" Sam exclaimed in a hushed tone, as a glint caught his eye. He thought he saw a ring roll under a nearby fish cart during the chaos. But for now, their focus remained on the violence unfolding before them.

"Jonny Rain's message might bring hope to many," Mosses repeated softly, the words suddenly taking on a graver weight, "but at what cost?"

"Let's go," Ali said, pulling Sam and Mosses away from the harrowing scene. "We need to get back to school, and we need to be more careful.  We didn't come to Kampala for this."

7 - 8

As Mosses, Ali, and Sam made their way back to the Kampala Driving & Mechanic Training School. The city's soundscape was a collection of blaring horns, boisterous market chatter, and distant music drifting through the air. A chill ran down Mosses' spine, his thoughts consumed by the brutal assault they had witnessed earlier. He could still hear the man's cries echoing in his ears.

"Webale kujja," Ali muttered, using the local greeting as he held open the school gate for his friends. "We made it back."

"Yiya, but we can't forget what we saw today," Sam replied solemnly. "This city is not as safe as we thought. We must be more careful from now on."

As the trio entered the assembly hall, they found Mr. Okello standing at the lectern, his expression grave. The other students sat in hushed anticipation, sensing that something was amiss. Mosses felt a knot forming in his stomach, wondering if word had already spread about the attack.

"Good evening, students," Mr. Okello began. "I have called you all here to remind you of the importance of being vigilant and cautious in our beloved city. There are forces at work that threaten our safety, and we must take every precaution to protect ourselves and each other."

He paused, surveyed the sea of young, attentive faces, and took a deep breath. "Now hear me out," he continued, the gravity in his tone becoming more pronounced. "The incidents we have been hearing about, the gang wars, the late-night assaults, the political tensions seeping into our streets... these are not just news items to be glanced over. These are perilous waves hitting our shores."

He looked around, letting the weight of his words anchor in the minds of his young proteges before soldiering on. "We must take every measure, every possible step to protect ourselves and each other. Life has handed us wrenches not only to tighten the nuts and bolts of automobiles, but also to secure the safety of our lives."

He walked over to the large map of Kampala pinned on the wall behind him and traced the city boundaries. "These gates," he said pointing towards the school gates, "serve not just as an entry or exit point to our esteemed institution, but also as a reminder. A reminder that exploration has limits. Yes, your elders may seem irrationally cautious to your young minds, but there is one rule that you must obey religiously: never, and I mean never, leave school after sundown."

Mosses took a deep breath, desperately trying to keep his fears at bay at the dire possibilities Okello alluded to. He could tell from the faces around him that the gravity of Okello's words was striking a grim chord with everyone.

Okello’s voice softened, 

"You are in Kampala but this school is our home. And you have all come here to learn and grow, to build a brighter future for yourselves and your families. This school will provide you with the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed, but it is up to each of you to put in the hard work and dedication required. Follow the rules, respect your peers and instructors, and never forget the reason you are here." Mr. Okello continued. "It is crucial that you remain vigilant and aware of your surroundings at all times. If you see anything suspicious or out of the ordinary, report it immediately to a member of staff."

"Sir," Sam interjected, his voice wavering slightly. "What about our families and friends who live in the city? How can we ensure their safety as well?"

"Sam, we cannot control everything that happens outside these walls," Mr. Okello said gently. "But all of you are welcome to go home when you want, but once you leave. you cannot return.  There are many others who want your position in this school."

"Mr Okello," another student asked hesitantly, "what should we do if we find ourselves in a dangerous situation outside of school grounds?"

"First, try to remove yourself from the situation as quickly and safely as possible," Mr. Okello advised. "Find a trusted adult or authority figure, such as a police officer, who can assist you. But remember, prevention is key. Avoid taking unnecessary risks, and always stay within the designated areas when you leave the school premises."

As the students absorbed this information, Mosses knew he needed to adapt to the city, to learn its rhythms and navigate its complexities, but the thought of facing a gang like B13 worried him.

"If there are not more questions," Mr. Okello concluded, his gaze sweeping over the sea of faces before him. "Let me say this last thing. You are not just students; you are part of the Kampala Driving & Mechanics School family, and we must work together to ensure that everyone stays safe."

With that, the assembly was dismissed, and the students filed out, their thoughts heavy with the implications of the world beyond the school's gates. Mosses, Ali, and Sam walked together in silence, each lost in their own thoughts.

 

Mosses found himself lost in thought, when Ali spoke up.

"Wish these worried faces were due to a tough car engine problem," Ali commented lightly, breaking the silence and pointing to a group of students engaged in hushed discussions. The attempt at humor, although fell flat, eased the tense atmosphere a bit.

Moses stifled a yawn and rubbed his eyes, which were red from exhaustion. "I think it's time I try to get some sleep," he said, gazing out the window at the inky night sky. "Class tomorrow."

Ali gave a nod. "Good idea," they said, then waved to Sam. Sam remained in the hallway, deep in thought.


9 - 10

Mosses jolted awake to the sound of deafening voices coming from outside his window. His heart stopped cold as he peeked through the curtains and saw a menacing group of B13 gang members, their weapons gleaming in the moonlight as they shouted threats at one another. In a frenzied panic Mosses scrambled to shut and lock the window before plunging his room into darkness. He held his breath, praying that no one had seen him inside, as he curled up beneath the bed with his eyes still glued on the locked door.

As the B13 gang members' harsh laughter and crude shouts echoed eerily in Mosses' mind, the scene slowly dissolved into a foggy nothingness, replacing the violent images with a massive wave of quietness. It was as if someone hit the mute button on a monstrous television. Sweating and shuddering, Mosses gasped, realizing it had all been a nightmare. His heart raced as he steadied himself.

Suddenly, the stoic silhouette of Sam appeared in front of him.

"Mosses, it was a nightmare. You're safe.", Sam's calm voice cut through the anxious silence.

"Why are you here, Sam?" Mosses enquired, slowly regaining his composure.

"With a surprise, mate," Sam unlocked his phone, revealing a photo display of Johnny Rain standing next to a man they’d unfortunately crossed paths with earlier that evening. "Our mystery man is not merely a Rain enthusiast. Caption reads, 'Tour life alongside my trustworthy campaign manager.’ That man we saw thrashed is tied to Rain, closer than we presumed."

"Wait, Sam?", Mosses voiced out, cut short as Sam flipped to the next picture — a close-up of the same man sporting an intricately designed ring. The familiarity struck Mosses like a bolt of lightning.

"Remember the street scuffle when a ring came loose from our man's hand and rolled away underneath the nearby fish cart? That's it!” Sam pointed at the phone screen. “It's the same ring."

"But, Mr. Okello—" Mosses started nervously, only for Sam to overrun his concerns.

"Consider this. Johnny Rain's clout and financial backing could make that ring's reward lucrative," Sam's voice held a manipulative strategy, his eyes gleaming with an opportunity about to be hatched. "Enough, perhaps, to purchase the whole of our school, if wishes had wings. Mosses, you in for a city ride? A ring retrieval mission with me?"

Mosses stuttered, "What about Ali? Is he in on it?"

“No, I had to get you onboard first,” Sam's voice was instantly defensive. "You see, Ali's a diehard fan of Rain. Get him involved, and he'll most likely keep the ring as a trophy. But you, you seemed indifferent. May even have some lean towards the current government."

"Me, Pro Government?!” Mosses said.

"I'm just working off our conversation earlier," Sam shrugged, nonchalantly. 

"You seem mesmerized by President Mugisha, ever since that handshake. Don't you think that treads dangerously close to propagandist territory? Or is it outright annoyance towards Johnny Rain?"

"What! Sam, that's not fair," Mosses bit back, temper flaring.

"Well, prove me wrong, Mosses," Sam demanded, a smug smirk playing across his lips in the dark room. "Prove that you can set aside your love for the President, and help me get Johnny Rain’s friend, his ring back."

Mosses thought for a moment, remembering Mr. Okello’s words about the importance of vigilance and self-care in the city, he responded, 'No, Sam, I came here to learn mechanics and I am going back to sleep. Goodnight."



Episode 3
1 - 2
Kampala's Driving & Mechanic Training School bustled with activity with the clattering sounds of the tools and the focused hush of students. Rows of well-used mechanical equipment spread across the wide space. Students, crouched over or bent around the machines, were dressed in uniforms stained with grease, hinting at the countless hours of hard work put in.
The clanging of tools and the hum of engines filled the air as Moses carefully pried open the carburetor, his brow furrowed in concentration. Ali, at the adjacent table, was elbows-deep in an engine block, his expression a blend of determination and frustration. The workshop felt off-kilter without Sam for them both.
"Apwoyo matek," Moses mumbled to himself, wiping the sweat from his brow. He marveled at how far he'd come since arriving from Mbarara. The complex machinery that had once seemed so daunting now resembled a familiar puzzle, waiting for him to unlock its secrets.
"Ali," he called out, "have you seen Sam today? He's never late like this." Just as Moses finished speaking, Sam burst into the workshop, his eyes wide.
"Moses, you won't believe what I found last night! It's the ring I told you about from the fight!" he exclaimed, thrusting his hand forward to reveal a glinting ring. Ali gave a puzzled glance toward Moses before turning his attention back to Sam.
"What?" Ali asked, his voice grounded and cautious.
"Ali, yesterday when we were walking downtown Kampala and saw the Jonny Rain fan get beaten up by those B13 gangsters, I noticed a ring roll under the fish market stand," Sam said exuberantly. "But that isn't the most interesting part. I heard something huge."
Moses and Ali drew closer, curiosity piqued. Sam's animated demeanor was infectious, and they couldn't help but lean in to hear more.
"Hear me out," Sam whispered, "I heard a conversation between a sharply dressed man with expensive wooden glasses and Cato, the notorious B13 gang leader."
"Are you sure it was Cato?" Moses interjected, his heart pounding at the mere mention of the feared gangster.
"Positive," Sam affirmed. "They were discussing some sort of sabotage. I couldn't make out all the details, but they sounded as if all the power in Kampala would go out during the Johnny Rain broadcast."
Ali's eyes darted around the workshop nervously before he said. "We need to tell Mr. Okello," he declared, his voice firm. As soon as Sam nodded in agreement, Ali was off to Mr. Okello’s office, sharing their newfound conspiracy theory with the schools instructor.
"You should have come with me last night Mosses, can you imagine if the President were to get away with such a thing?" Sam mused aloud, the thrill of unearthing a potential scandal coursing through him.  Moses shook his head, chuckling at Sam's tale. "You're just saying this because you've always been a fan of Johnny Rain," he accused, casting a skeptical glance at Sam.
"Ah, Moses, I'm serious!" Sam protested, throwing his hands up in exasperation. But Moses couldn't help smirking – it seemed all too convenient that he'd stumbled upon such a conspiracy.
"Look at this Moses," Sam said, rotating the ring slowly in his fingers. "Do you understand the size of what's happening? It's not just about this ring but what it represents. Jonny Rain is not just another politician. He wants real changes for Uganda, and these people, they want to stop that at all costs. They are going to plunge our city into darkness!"
Before he could answer, Ali came back with a message from Mr. Okello—he wanted to speak to all three of them.

As they knocked on the instructor’s room, Moses couldn’t help but feel his hands grow clammy. There was a certain degree of respect and fear that Mr. Mr. Okello commanded a certain degree of respect and fear, and for Moses, this was his first encounter with a situation larger than he’d prefer to deal with.
"Watye ki?" came Mr. Okello's familiar baritone voice. Moses glanced at Sam and Ali before entering.
Mr.Okello's office was a stark contrast to the workshop. The room was smaller, filled with the scent of homemade food and machinery oil. Stacks of manuals and notebooks piled high on the lone wooden desk. The walls were adorned with photos of past students and the occasional motivational poster.
Mr. Okello listened attentively as Sam spilled out the tale completely. At the mention of Cato, Mr. Okello raised an eyebrow. He remained silent after Sam finished, taking a moment to gather his thoughts.
"Sam, true or not," he chuckled darkly, "matters of politics and the city's troubles aren't to be toyed with.  But most of all they are not this school’s worries."
Moses felt a twinge of relief at hearing Mr. Okello’s echoing sentiment.
Ali, on the other hand, though uncomfortable himself, pointed out a relevant concern. “But sir, if Sam's story is true, couldn’t it affect us all?” He questioned.
Mr. Okello looked thoughtful for a moment before replying, “You boys are here to learn a trade and improve your futures.  Everything else is a distraction.”
With a nod of understanding, the trio exited Mr. Okello's office. 
"History is penned by those brave enough to chase it, Moses," Sam retorted, frustration creeping into his voice. "True or not, shouldn't we at least try to find Johnny Rain and worn him? If this is true, we could stop a potentially dangerous event."
Moses shook his head, "Mr. Okello is right, Sam. We are here to learn, not to get entangled in these dangerous plots."
Sam looked at Ali and said, “It feels lately like the President is controlling our instructor and our friend.” He said glancing back at Mosses.

It was another busy day at the Kampala Driving & Mechanic Training School workshop. Moses and Ali, however, felt almost disconnected from the flurry of activity around them. The burden of Sam's revelation had hung over them like a dark cloud ever since he shared the news. Their normally fun back and forth had now been replaced with serious, often whispered conversations. 
A murmur ran through the workshop as Mr. Okello announced they'd be tuning into Johnny Rain's much-anticipated interview. Moses concentrated on his carburetor but stole concerned glances at Sam, who seemed more reserved and quiet than usual. 
"I still can't believe Sam thinks they would sabotage the interview," one student whispered to another, disbelief coloring his tone.
"Yeah," his friend replied, smirking as he wiped his oily hands on a rag. "He's always had wild theories."
Mosses was a bit shocked that word has spread so fast. 
The interview with Johnny Rain echoed from the old radio in the corner of the workshop, the broadcaster's voice brimming with excitement. Moses felt a subtle pang of resentment. Discomfort prickled at him, his thoughts spiraling back to Sam's warning about the planned citywide power outage at Rain's speech.
Suddenly, the sound from the radio faltered, and there was only static. All chatter and movement in the workshop ceased as students exchanged bewildered glances in the sudden pause that fell over the room. Had the blackout Sam had warned about had happened?
Moses clenched his fist around his tools, sighing to himself. Politics had once again interfered with his mission in Kampala.
He glanced at Sam, expecting to see satisfaction. Yet, Sam's face was grave as he starred at the malfunctioning carburetor in front of him. 
Just as Moses was about to return to his work, the workshop was plunged into darkness. The radio static replaced by, shocked gasps of the school’s students hanging in the air. 
It was as if time stopped. Moses felt a chill as he remembered Sam's warning and then the uncomfortable realization; the blackout was real. It wasn't just Sam's wild theory anymore. 
"Sam." Ali's voice wavered in the dark. "You were right… we all thought… but...you were right."
The tension in the room was punctuated by Ali's phone lighting up. He hastily picked it up and, under the glares of the room, everyone heard the talkative young man say, "I need to let Mr. Okello know."
While Ali relayed the information to the others, there was an eerie silence. Moses felt a sudden jolt of anxiety. He realized then - they were in the heart of a dangerous plot. With whispers spreading like wildfire, the once energetic workshop was caught in the storm of suspicion and fear.
"Imagine the chaos if the press gets this," Sam said, his voice barely above a whisper. Moses blinked at him, his mind spiraling into a maze of dread. Like storm clouds that he’d ignored all day
5 - 6
The following day Sam seemed to be running away from the school, his feet barely touching the ground. His eyes were wide and frightened as he shot a glance at Moses and Ali before turning away. “My mum’s really sick,” he stammered as he ran. The sun had just begun to dip below the horizon, making the sky look like an oil painting, but all they felt was dread.
"Things have changed without Sam around," Ali remarked a few days later, sighing heavily. "Remember our agreement? We said we'd stick together no matter what."
"Enkya," Moses replied, staring at the empty workbench where Sam used to tinker with engines. "I'll talk to Mr. Okello. Maybe he knows something we don't."
Moses walked through the school corridors with determination. As he approached Mr. Okello's office, he paused, taking a deep breath before knocking on the door.
"Yiya," Mr. Okello's voice called from within. Moses entered, but stopped short at the sight before him. There, standing inside the office was a man matching Sam's description of the man with the expensive wooden glasses. A chill ran down Moses' spine as he hastily retreated.
"Ali!" Moses whispered urgently when he found him. "I saw the man! With the wooden glasses in Mr. Okello's office!"
"Are you sure?" Ali asked, concern creeping into his voice.
"I am certain. Maybe you should call Sam,” Moses suggested, his heart pounding.
Ali hesitated for a moment, glanced at Moses with worry etched intensely on his face, and then nodded. As he dialed Sam's number, his mind raced with questions. What did this man want with their school? Did Mr. Okello know him?
"Hello?" Sam's voice came through, sounding distant and guarded.
"Sam, it's me," Ali replied, his voice shaking. "Moses saw him – the man with the wooden glasses."
"Listen," Sam said, his tone stern. "Don’t call me again. "
"Alright," Ali agreed reluctantly, ending the call. Moses looked at him expectantly, his eyes full of worry. Ali hesitated, then decided to share Sam's warning. "Sam told us to stay away from the man and focus on our studies," he said, trying to sound more assured than he felt. "He'll handle it."
"Let's hope so," Moses mumbled, unconvinced.
They both returned to their work.
7 - 8
The sun cast a warm glow over the Kampala Driving & Mechanic Training School, but the atmosphere within its walls was anything but comforting. Whispers and rumors had spread like wildfire among the students, and Moses couldn't help but feel a constant sense of unease as he worked on his brake exam.
"Did you hear?" one student said in hushed tones to another. "They say those three knew about the plot and didn't do anything."
"Bringing politics into our school," another muttered, shaking his head in disapproval. "I thought we were here to learn, not to get involved in dangerous games."
Moses clenched his jaw as he tried to focus on the complex mechanical components before him. He'd heard these whispers countless times over the past few days, each one chipping away at his resolve. The weight of the rumors bore down on him, suffocating him with their insidious implications.
"Ali," Moses whispered, wiping the sweat from his brow. "It's getting worse. We've got to act."
"Like what?" Ali replied, his voice low and steady. "We don't even know what's going on. And besides, Sam told us to stay out of it."
"Maybe that was a mistake," Moses admitted, his hands trembling ever so slightly as he adjusted a brake pad. "Maybe we should have warned Johnny Rain."
"Or maybe we would have just made things worse," Ali countered, his eyes darting around the workshop, wary of eavesdroppers. "We can't change the past, Moses. All we can do is stick together and try to make it through this."
As they continued working, the sound of footsteps approaching sent a jolt of adrenaline coursing through Moses' veins. He looked up to see the well-dressed man with expensive wooden glasses strolling confidently across the workshop floor.
"Hello, boys, my apologies. This will only be a brief interruption for twelve of you. I am looking for Ali Bahri" the man said, his voice smooth and unsettling. As a few people looked around counting how many people were in the room "I'm here to ask you a few questions about the recent power outage in Kampala."
"Who are you?" Ali demanded, his expression hardening as he stood protectively in front of Moses.
"Ah, my apologies," the man replied, feigning surprise. "My name is Mr. Ssenyonjo, and I was commissioned by the President to investigate whether any… malicious intent was behind the blackout during Johnny Rain's interview."
"Wh-what does that have to do with us?" Moses stammered, his heart pounding in his chest.
"Your friend Sam seemed quite interested in the matter," Mr. Ssenyonjo continued, his gaze fixed on Ali. "I was hoping you might be able to shed some light on his… concerns."
Ali swallowed hard, his hands clenched into fists at his sides. He glanced at Moses, who could see the fear flickering behind his eyes. But when Ali spoke, his voice was calm and steady.
"Sam isn't here right now," Ali said firmly. "And we don't know anything about the power outage. We're just trying to focus on our studies."
"Of course," Mr. Ssenyonjo making a weak attempt at pretending to be surprised , his smile unnerving. "My father used to say that an education was the gateway to success.  He would speak of school life as if as if it were a lifeline sea of societal chaos," Mr. Ssenyonjo continued, his voice serenely low, an oasis-like contradiction to the distress Moses felt rising within him. He adjusted his wooden glasses, their polished presence throwing odd reflections amidst the engine parts under the workshop's buzzing lights.
Casually, almost purposefully out of place amidst the dirty tools and oil-slicked floors, he produced a folded paper from his pocket. "Oh, speaking of lifelines..." he said, slowing unfolding the folded paper.
"It seems that a call was made from a mobile phone," Mr. Ssenyonjo continued, his voice still calm and steady but edged with an intensity that sent a chill down Moses' spine. "A call from a mobile which seems to have slipped through the cracks of this school's records. The call was made to your friend Sam, amongst the time I was here a few days ago."
He paused once more, allowing the implication to sink in. The hushed whispers of the classroom fell into a deep silence.
"May I see your cell phone, young man?" he asked, extending a gloved hand to Ali.
Ali, visibly trembling, turned to his friend, Moses, a silent plea for support. But Moses, torn by guilt and the growing seeds of his own disdain for the situation they found themselves in, could only return a helpless gaze, before turning his attention to the book in front of him. Making him the only student in the classroom who had started to continue their car brake exercise given to them by Mr. Okello.
Ali handed his phone to Mr. Ssenyonjo who received it, his satisfied grin increasing the suffocating tension for e in everyone in the room except Mosses who was working on the project before him. 
After matching the phone number on the folder paper and Ali’s mobile phone, Ali was promptly arrested and his dreams of escaping the societal turmoil through education vaporized under the harsh gaze of Mr. Ssenyonjo.
As the classroom door closed behind Ali and Mr. Ssenyonjo, leaving Moses alone with his guilt and fear, the only sound was the ceaseless tick of the classroom clock and Mosses working on his braking excesses.
9 - 10
Mosses sat in his dorm room, staring blankly at the wall in front of him. He couldn't shake the feeling of guilt that had settled in his chest, knowing that he had played a part in Ali's arrest. He had been too afraid to speak up, too afraid to confront the man in the workshop. And now Ali was paying the price for his cowardice.  The dorm room was quiet and empty, but Moses could still hear the whispers of the other students echoing in his mind. Moses felt his legs taking him, almost as if guided by some unseen force, out of the dormitory and towards the lake. He had never seen Lake Victoria before, but today he needed something more than a silence. He wanted peace.  The peace he felt back home.  Lake Victoria felt as large as the ocean. There would be peace there.
Before the first rays of dawn had a chance to perk above the horizon, Moses found himself nestled in his bed, awake. Sleep had become an elusive companion recently since guilt became his mistress. Within the confines of his drab dorm room, the inky shadows cast by the sporadic yellow of a flickering bulb morphed into monstrous whispers of fear and regret. His heart felt heavy at the thought of Ali sitting in a prison. He suddenly longed for the silence call of nature.  He looked at a map and decided to take a short trip to Lake Vitoria to clear his mind.
Leaving the clutches of the dread-filled dormitory, he found anticipating the calm and welcoming shores of Lake Victoria on this early morning.
The journey from the dormitory to the lake, which usually felt like an adventure, felt more like a funeral procession in the early light of dawn. A stillness hung in the air, amplifying the distant sound of the lake's gentle lapping. As he approached, the typically lively lakeside was unnaturally hushed—no morning birds or frogs to announce the birth of the new day—as if nature itself had decided to share in his mournful meditation for Ali.
As Moses approached the shores of Lake Victoria, he couldn't help but remember his mother's words of wisdom, "Be kind to others, work hard, and never forget where you come from." He wondered if he had forgotten those words in the face of the city's chaos. The water, which usually shimmered and danced under the enchanting morning sun, lay unusually still. It was as if the lake was holding its breath, its usual twinkling eyes dull and apprehensive. The tranquil atmosphere was a stark contrast to the storm brewing within Moses, adding another layer of estrangement to the environment that was supposed to be his and his friends' solace.
He examined the serene landscape one last time before sliding onto the dew-draped grass by the water's edge. The cool kiss of the grass blades provided a momentary relief from his inner turmoil. Silhouetting against the breaking dawn with rippling mirages of orange and purples, Moses felt a strange humming vibration coursing through him.
The eerie hum, pulsating in unison with his throbbing heartbeat, seemed to echo from the depths of the lake. Its rise and fall lulled him into a trance-like state, the world around him receding into a blur. Moses tried to decipher the enigmatic hum, but it was elusive, slipping through the clutches of his understanding.
Without warning, an invisible force gripped him from his trance. Startled, Moses had no time to react. His world evaporated into a maelstrom of sheer white as he was yanked off his feet and thrust headlong into the heart of the mysterious energy surrounding him. Where there had been a serene lakeside, a silent vortex exploded into life.
A multi-hued whirlwind of colors and shapes spiraled around him, the grass beneath him exchanged for an abyss of uncertainty. The laws of reality distorted and contorted as the vortex pulled him into an imploding chaos. Time and space lost meaning as he spiraled down the vortex - a violent, kaleidoscopic journey through the unknown. His scream was lost in the tumultuous whirl of energy that devoured him whole.
As Moses walked closer to the lake, he noticed that it seemed strangely still; no birds chirping or frogs croaking- almost as if they had all stopped in unison to mourn Ali's fate, an irony that filled his thoughts as he neared Lake Victoria’s edge. 
Moses couldn't shake off the feeling of guilt eating at his heart.  Overwhelmed by all thoughts, he deeply wished the lake would take away his guilt and worries.
The morning sun reflected off of the still waters, sending a prism of light dancing along every wave and ripple. Moses felt himself relax slightly as he started to sit down near the edge of Lake Victoria. In that moment of calm, an eerie hum started to fill his ears like the sound you hear when you blow into a sea shell. Suddenly, he felt a tug on his shoulder before he saw himself pulled off of his feet and into a swirling vortex, dragging him into its center. Then, as quickly as it had arrived, the chaotic vortex was gone and the edge of Lake Victoria was empty.
