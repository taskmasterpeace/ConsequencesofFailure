Original pitch: Consequences of Failure is an animated anthology series set in a make-believe contemporary world that follows the personal stories of several people from around the world who are caught up in the escalating crisis of living superweapons.
This is a world where a single mother in India who is the world's first time traveler is recruited to join India's Establishment 24. Where a blind and elderly massage therapist becomes the most beloved man in the country in China, under the watchful eye of a envious President and party leader. There are other key stories taking place in one of the 170 countries that populate his world. As a function of its grand narrative of adventure, intrigue, and power this property has the potential to appeal to a global audience.
Superhero Tactics will tell stories about people and deal with social issues around the world that are often ignored by traditional media outlets and science fiction. In a world where superpowers and super knowledge was not given to people who would use them for malicious intentions, there are no traditional supervillains in SuperHero Tactics.
The series will have a dark and suspenseful tone, with characters that are struggling to do what is right in a world that is constantly against them. Superhero Tactics is a series that will inspire thought and discussion about the social issues that it addresses and the technological concerns that it raises. SuperHero Tactics is meant for a mature audience and will not shy away from graphic violence or difficult social and subject matter.
In this world, ordinary individuals are just as powerful as those with extraordinary abilities. There are also individuals who possess political positions or resources that make them equally as deadly. In conclusion I offer a quote from one of the inhabitants of this world, a former


 Nigerian pilot turned living superweapon and world leader, "The villain of the world is not he with the fangs and cape, but he who preys on the innocent and vulnerable"
