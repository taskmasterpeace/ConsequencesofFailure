One night, Rusty Richards, one of the world’s most beloved musicians, was on his yacht celebrating the recent success of his latest album.


Mr. Richards leaves the dancefloor to take a phone call telling his girlfriend the music inside was too loud for him to properly hear the conversation he was attempting to have.


When he stepped onto the deck to take the phone call, what happened continues to be a mystery to this day.


For years to come the public assumed that the overconsumption of alcohol lead to him falling into the ocean. Or perhaps his girlfriend was somehow responsible for him vanishing from the face of the Earth.


Two years later when he suddenly reappeared on a football field in Derby, Australia every news publication in the country wanted to sit down with him for his first interview.


Instead, he gives a press conference and insists on an international audience to hear him deliver an unbelievable message to the world.


According to Richards.  four intergalactic civilizations have formed an alliance whose purpose is to invade, occupy and implement the atmospheric transformation of Earth. Effectively ending life as we know it.


The armada of highly trained militarized alien force will arrive on earth in just over 8 years.


As a response, a race of highly advanced dimensional travelers has decided to provide aid to humanity in preparation for the upcoming war. Rusty Richards predicted that in the coming weeks a select group of citizens all over the world will become passengers to another dimension. Before being returned home, these people would be forever transformed into the world's living superweapons.


After people all around the world who had been missing for weeks, started to reappear with new and extraordinary knowledge, creatures, and abilities, Rusty Richards gained a cult-like following around the world


Before long large and small countries alike begin to enlist any superpowered citizen they could find, for ‘defense’ purposes. Though not all countries can control or employ their superpowered citizens.


The potential for mass destruction is truly on display when the island nation of Cuba sends its team of powerful living super-weapons to an Airforce base in Miami, Florida to settle an immigration dispute involving a particularly ‘gifted’ Cuban-born child. Following the infamous ‘Tragedy at Andrews’, the United States found that it was ill-prepared for the new age of superpowered soldiers that every country in the world now has at its disposal.
Using its influence on the UN Security Council the White House was able to pass the ‘Living Super Weapon Threshold Treaty’ strictly prohibiting living superweapons from entering foreign territories with severe penalties for countries who violate the treaty.


Amidst historic levels of national outrage, the White House turned toward the private sector. Popular internet entrepreneur and well-known UFO enthusiast Vaughn Galloway was asked to lead a private paramilitary organization codenamed FIST First Infantry Strike Team. Composed of scientists, soldiers & living superweapons. 


To the public, they were viewed as America's answer to the emerging LSW threats. While Washington saw them as an extension of America's intelligence, law enforcement, and military services. Nothing more.


The United Nations General Assembly requested to hear Vaughn Galloway and his group of scientists present their independently funded report on Living Super Weapons to the world’s nations. The presentation was met with a variety of reactions, with several nations viewing living superweapons as a chance to strengthen their global stature while others seeing them as an existential threat. 


Vaugh Galloway brought his speech to a close at the United Nations General Assembly by reminding everyone that in order to guarantee the safety of all nations,calling for a unified global research effort to find a way to defend against the rumored alien armada that would arrive in 8 years. or the nations of the world could form a coalition to share resources and knowledge in order to prepare for the attack. .  He proposed the creation of SPEAR, Special Personnel for Extraterrestrial Assault & Research with himself as the Director. Instead of FIST's current headquarters outside of Washington, D.C., SPEAR would be based at the Vaughn Galloway Science and Learning Center in Geneva, Switzerland. It would reflect a global commitment to the cause even if China and Russia wernt on board.


The United Nations General Assembly had convened to hear the report on Living Super Weapons from Vaughn Galloway and his team of scientists. The reactions to their findings were mixed, with some nations viewing the potential of living superweapons as a way to bolster their influence in the global arena while others saw them as a potential threat to humanity's very existence. (Many didn’t credit Rusty Richards so they dont believe the alien invasion part, some think the United States was involved somehow)


Vaughn Galloway stepped up to the podium and addressed the assembly, painting a vivid picture of the dangers that lie ahead if the world does not act swiftly and decisively. He warned of a future in which the world is divided into two camps: those who possess living superweapons and those who don't. He also proposed that creation of SPEAR, involve  a global network of highly trained superweapons dedicated to peace keeping efforts, with its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. (How is he able to get them to vote? lol). They laughed at him wanting to control his own private army. 


The United States, and the United Kingdom  were the first to veto the proposal. The United Kingdom, France, and Germany followed suit. China and Russian Federation obstanted. Several small nations then voiced their support for Galloway's proposal, but the damage had been done. The proposal failed and Vaughn Galloway would later state that the decision at the UNGA, “could end up being the worst mistake in human history,".Vaughn immediately scheduled a review from the United Nations Security Council and they declined. 
As the Living Superweapon Threshold Treaty is violated with increasing regularity, and nations around the world scramble to find their own 'superweapons' in order to maintain an edge, it seems increasingly likely that humanity is on a path toward self-destruction. With no clear international solution in sight, it appears that each nation will have to fend for itself in this new age of superpowered warfare.




Implement those as ways to improve the alien angle


#1 The UN Security Council could pass a resolution calling for a unified global research effort to find a way to defend against the alien armada, or the nations of the world could form a coalition to share resources and knowledge in order to prepare for the attack. This could create a sense of urgency and unity among the nations of the world, as well as an understanding of the need for cooperation and compromise between nations. Additionally, the search for living superweapons could be portrayed as a race against the clock to find a way to defend against the impending alien threat. This could also create tension and suspense in the story, as the reader is left wondering if the nations of the world will be able to find a way to defend against the alien armada in time.


#2 Vaughn Galloway could re-propose his SPEAR initiative in a more desperate attempt to unify the nations of the world against the alien threat. He could call for a renewed sense of urgency among the nations of the world in order to prepare for the impending alien threat. This could create a sense of global unity and shared purpose, as the nations of the world come together to face this common enemy. Alternatively, the nations of the world could reject the SPEAR initiative, creating a sense of hopelessness and despair as the world seemingly prepares for its own destruction. This could lead to a sense of desperation among the characters as they attempt to find a way to defend against the alien armada in time.

Rusty Richard Press Conference Summary:


Good evening everyone. My name is Rusty Richards and I'm here to tell you a story. Two years ago, on a night that I had been celebrating the success of my latest album, I stepped onto the deck of my yacht to take a phone call and vanished from the face of the earth.


For two years, I was missing and many assumed I had been taken by drug smugglers or had fallen off my yacht into the ocean. But I'm here to tell you the truth.


Two years ago, I was taken by an intergalactic civilization to warn the world of a plan to invade, occupy, and transform our planet. The culture that took me is not our enemy; rather, they are attempting to protect us from a much greater threat – a massive armada of highly trained militarized aliens who are planning to come to our planet in just over 8 years.


In response to this coming threat, a race of highly advanced dimensional travelers has decided to provide aid to humanity in preparation for the upcoming war. This aid takes the form of living superweapons. Recently, people around the world have started to reappear with knowledge, creatures, and abilities beyond our wildest dreams. We now know that these people are the living superweapons the culture gave us to help us defend ourselves against the coming invasion.


Unfortunately, not all countries can control or employ their superpowered citizens. This is why I'm here today, to urge the nations of the world to unite. We must not use these living superweapons to fight each other; rather, we must work together to prepare for the coming war.


To this end, I am proposing the creation of an international team of highly trained superweapons dedicated to peace. I'm calling this team SPEAR, or Special Personnel for Extraterrestrial Assault & Research. This team would be based at the Vaughn Galloway Science and Learning Center in Geneva, Switzerland.


This is a call to action – a call to join forces and fight as one. The time is now. We must band together and stop this impending force of destruction before it's too late. We must come together and use our collective powers to protect our planet and our people.


This moment is a chance for us to stand together and make a difference. To make sure that we, and our children, will have a future. Please, I urge you all to join me in this important mission. Thank you for your time.

Chapter 1: The Night That Changed Everything


Rusty Richards stood surrounded by a sea of admirers from every corner of the world. International celebrities, music moguls, and long-time friends filled the deck, their excited whispers a testament to Rusty's global fame. Soft waves lapped at the hull, providing a soothing rhythm to the raucous laughter and vibrant conversations taking place aboard. At the heart of the room, a pedestal held the prestigious award he had just received – the Glamorous Lyrist, an ornate golden music note embellished with diamonds, its glimmer reflecting the awe in the guests' eyes.


In the center of his luxurious 350-foot yacht, Rusty Richards stood in the adoration of admirers from every corner of the world. The salty cool caribbean breeze, providing a soothing rhythm to the raucous laughter and vibrant conversations filling the yacht. International celebrities, music moguls, and long-time friends gathered in the main salon, entranced by the sight of the prestigious award Rusty had received: the Glamorous Lyrist, an ornate golden music note embellished with diamonds.


He raised his glass, and the room instantly fell silent. His piercing blue eyes scanned the crowd, his magnetic presence drawing them into his orbit. "Tonight, ladies and gentlemen, we're not just celebrating this award; we're celebrating our victory against something greater. This is a defining moment in the history of humanity. We've triumphed over the machines," Rusty announced with a crooked smile. All eyes remained on him, captivated, as the assembled guests erupted into applause, some chanting 'John Henry' amidst the cheers. Rusty knew he was the living symbol of hope for artists worldwide, struggling to make their mark in the age of AI-generated music.


As the noise settled down, it was replaced by the rhythmic beats of a band, and guests resumed their conversations. Hollywood directors, European royalty, and local musicians alike were greeted and engaged by Rusty with genuine warmth. Witnessing a man who dominated TV screens and music charts mingling effortlessly with people from various backgrounds was not only remarkable but also created an atmosphere buzzing with energy.


During the party, Rusty and Sarah danced to the music playing on the yacht as his catchy tunes filled the Caribbean air. Each song that resonated throughout the night showcased Rusty's undeniable talent and his well-deserved status as a living legend. 


As the evening progressed, Rusty spotted his friend and occasional collaborator, a Chicago musician known as '2 Glocks.' A controversial figure, 2 Glocks was recognized for his raw style, unapologetic lyrics, and as a significant presence in the drill scene that had swept the nation.


Despite their contrasting backgrounds and artistic styles, Rusty and 2 Glocks shared a unique bond, finding common ground in their passion for creative expression. 2 Glocks approached Rusty, a sly grin on his face, extending his hand for a firm shake.


"Rusty, wussup boy!" 2 Glocks said, his voice carrying the unmistakable accent of his Chicago roots. "I gotta say, this yacht party's got that magic touch, you know? I like this."


Rusty chuckled, "Coming from the king of the drill scene, I'll take it as a high compliment, brother."


2 Glocks nodded, "Hey, we may be from different worlds, but real recognizes real. You beat that AI, man. I respect that."


Rusty grinned, playfully nudging 2 Glocks. "Well, you're not doing too bad yourself, with all those awards piling up. You think your shelf can handle a few more?"


Both men laughed, but then 2 Glocks' expression changed to a more serious tone. "You know, speaking of AI, it's got me wonderin'... How long before that technology starts comin' for us, man? I mean,” taking a sip from his glass, “what's music gonna look like when machines can spit out tracks just like that?"


Rusty took a moment, deep in thought. "I feel you. AI might speed things up, but I believe there's something human that can't be mimicked—a realness in our music that a machine just won't have. Still, it's something we need to keep an eye on."


2 Glocks responded, "Yo, I thought street rap was safe since AI can't really be authentic in our world. But I heard of this kid who made a website that generates songs based on news stories. So if someone does something a rapper would do and it hits the news, the AI makes a song like it's from them."


Silence lingered for a moment before Rusty extended his hand. "You have a point, but let's face that challenge when we get there. Until then, and no matter what the future holds, let's keep making music that connects with people."


2 Glocks smiled, giving Rusty a firm handshake before pulling him in for a hug. "It might already be here, but whatever. We in this together, no matter what, boy."


With a firm agreement, they ended the conversation on good terms and returned to enjoying the yacht party, united in their shared passion for music.


As they parted ways, it was evident that the bond between Rusty and 2 Glocks transcended any perceived barriers their contrasting approaches to music could present.


Just as the siblings finished picking up the pieces of glass, Rusty's phone buzzed with an incoming call. He excused himself off the dance floor, waving to Sarah before heading to the deck, where the clamor of music and laughter gave way to the gentle sounds of the sea.


The conversation was brief but intense. Rusty's brow furrowed, his voice a quiet murmur, barely audible over the crashing waves. He would later claim that the call was about an old friend seeking life advice, but Emily noticed the tension in his body language and the way his skin paled.


After he hung up, Rusty leaned against the railing, lost for a moment in the moonlit ocean's vast expanse. The chill of the Caribbean wind swirled around him, doing nothing to ease the icy dread that had settled in his chest. Common sense told them Rusty had simply fallen overboard, but none could have anticipated the chaotic vortex that was rapidly approaching.


Before Rusty could react, the vortex enveloped him, appearing as a whirlwind of colors and energy. It seemed in that instant to be both otherworldly and yet bound to the natural forces of the universe. In a heartbeat, Rusty was gone.


The news of his disappearance spread throughout the yacht like wildfire. Tears streamed down Sarah's face, her body convulsing with sobs. Emily stood, her mouth

Rusty Richards stood in the center of his yacht, surrounded by a sea of admirers. Soft waves lapped at the hull, providing a soothing rhythm to the raucous laughter and vibrant conversations taking place aboard. On display was the prestigious award he had just received – the Glamorous Lyrist, an ornate golden music note embellished with diamonds. He raised his glass, and the room instantly fell silent. His piercing blue eyes scanned the crowd.


"Tonight, ladies and gentlemen, we're not just celebrating an award; we're celebrating our victory against something greater. This is a defining moment in the history of humanity. We've triumphed over the machines," Rusty announced with a crooked smile. The assembled guests erupted into applause, some chanting 'John Henry' amidst the cheers. Rusty knew that the growing presence of AI-generated music unsettled every musician gathered tonight.


The champagne flowed, and the air was electric with the collective energy of Rusty's closest friends and collaborators. He reveled in their adoration, his charismatic smile lighting up the room. He was the life of the party, the man of the hour, the beating heart of the music industry. No one could deny his influence, from record-shattering album sales to revolutionizing musical communication with his signature 'Conversation Codes.'


While the guests continued to celebrate, Rusty's girlfriend, Sarah, appeared in a radiant silver dress that captured every inch of spotlight. She was a vision of elegance, her eyes locked onto Rusty's as their hands entwined, and they moved to the dance floor.


Rusty and Sarah danced to the rhythm of a song that resonated through the yacht, the notes undulating in the warm Caribbean air. The moon cast a gentle glow upon their twisting forms, forging a moment that transcended time. In the gaze of his lover, Rusty could forget his fears about competing with TuringBeat, the AI artist responsible for the growing anxiety among musicians.


The crashing sound of glass shattering cut through the murmurs and music. Rusty's little sister, Emily, stood by a table, a broken champagne flute at her feet. Her expression was bashful yet fierce—a typical combination for a girl who grew up in the shadow of a celebrity brother.


With an apologetic grin, Rusty whispered something sweet into Sarah's ear, gently disentangling himself from her embrace. He made his way to Emily, wrapping an arm around her shoulders, and helped her clean the broken shards.


"Hey, it'll take more than TuringBeat to ruin this party, right?" Emily joked, attempting to diffuse her embarrassment. Rusty let out a chuckle that warmed her heart.


Just as the siblings finished picking up the pieces, Rusty's phone buzzed with an incoming call. He excused himself off the dance floor, waving to Sarah before heading to the deck, where the clamor of music and laughter gave way to the gentle sounds of the sea.

The news of his disappearance spread throughout the yacht like wildfire. Tears streamed down Sarah's face, her body convulsing with sobs. Emily stood, her mouth agape in shock, unable to comprehend the reality of the situation.


The night that began with a celebration of their triumph over the machines had transformed into their worst nightmare. Unbeknownst to them, Rusty would reappear years later, a somber man forever changed by the unfathomable events that transpired in the depths of the chaotic vortex.
