INT. MILITARY BASE - DAY


We see a group of soldiers training in hand-to-hand combat. One of them, TODD BENCHLEY (54), is standing in the middle of the group, watching and instructing. He is a no-nonsense kind of guy, and his face is lined with the scars of a life lived hard. He is wearing a black cowboy hat and a black M16 with a suppressor.


TODD: Alright, let's go again. This time, focus on your footwork and your positioning.


The soldiers start to spar again, and Todd watches them carefully.

VAUGHN: Todd, can I have a word?


TODD: Sure, what's up?


Vaughn leads Todd to a nearby office, where they sit down.


VAUGHN: Todd, I have a problem. A big problem.


TODD: What is it?


VAUGHN: There's a new threat out there. A race of self-evolving metal-based AI called the Iron Eaters. They consume everything in their path, and they're getting stronger every day.


TODD: I see. And what do you want me to do about it?


VAUGHN: I want you to put together a team of the best people in the world. People with special abilities, people with unique skills. People like you.


TODD: And what do you want us to do?


VAUGHN: I want you to stop the Iron Eaters.


TODD: That's a tall order, Vaughn. Are you sure you're ready for this?


VAUGHN: I'm sure. And I'm willing to pay whatever it takes.


TODD: Alright, then. Let's do it.


Vaughn and Todd shake hands, and the scene fades to black.

We see Todd and Vaughn sitting across from each other, discussing the details of their plan to stop the Iron Eaters.
VAUGHN: So, who do you have in mind for the team?
TODD: I've been thinking about that. I think we need a mix of people with different skills and abilities. Soldiers, scientists, engineers, and living superweapons.
VAUGHN: Who specifically?
TODD: Well, I've been working with a team of mercenaries for a while now. They're some of the best in the business. And I know a couple of scientists and engineers who are experts in their fields.
VAUGHN: And what about living superweapons?
TODD: I know a few people who fit that description. People with unique abilities, like super strength, telekinesis, or the ability to control elements.
VAUGHN: Okay, that sounds like a good start. What do you need from me?
TODD: I need funding, of course. And I need access to your resources and technology. We're going to need all the help we can get to stop the Iron Eaters.
