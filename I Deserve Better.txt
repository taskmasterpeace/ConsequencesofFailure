I Deserve Better Chapter 1
 Tyrell Lober sat at his desk, staring at the online marketplace on his phone. He was a tall, lean Black young man with short, twisted locks and a broad smile that seemed to light up his whole face. He had always been fascinated by technology and gadgets, and when he saw an ad for a new drone, he knew he had to have it. He had saved up enough money to make the purchase and eagerly placed the order. 
 
As he waited for the seller to respond, he checked the time on his phone. He had a lunch break coming up in a few minutes and had arranged to meet the seller in the parking lot of a nearby bank to make the exchange. The bank was a modern building situated in a busy part of the city.
 
Finally, a message popped up on his phone. "Hey, I'm in the parking lot now. I'll be waiting in a black sedan, spot number 37. See you soon!"


Tyrell quickly opened the timer app on his phone and set it for 1 hour. He gathered his things and headed out of his office building.
Walking to his car, he checked the timer to make sure it was set correctly and reminded himself to check it again before leaving the parking lot where he met the seller. He didn't want to get caught up in playing with his new drone and lose track of time.
 
As he pulled into the parking lot, he scanned the rows of cars until he spotted the black sedan in spot number 37. Tyrell parked his car and made his way over to the sedan.
 
He reached the car and knocked on the window. The door opened and a man stepped out. He was middle-aged, with graying hair and a friendly smile. He introduced himself as Ricky Jackson, the seller.
 
"Hey, nice to meet you," Tyrell said, extending his hand. "I'm Tyrell, I’m here for the drone."
 
"Nice to meet you too, Tyrell," Ricky replied, shaking Tyrell's hand. "It's practically brand new. Let me grab it for you."
 
"So, why are you selling it?" Tyrell asked as Ricky reached into his car to retrieve the drone.
 
"Well, I got a new job and I won't have as much time to fly it anymore," Ricky replied, pulling out the black drone and setting it on the ground. "It's only halfway charged, but it should be ready to fly by the time you get home."
 
"Oh, that's too bad," Tyrell said, a hint of disappointment in his voice. "I've been wanting a drone for a while now, but I never found the right one."
 
"Well, I'm sure you'll have a lot of fun with this one,"  Ricky said, handing the drone to Tyrell along with the remote control and a small bag containing the manual. "Just be careful and remember to not fly it near the airport."
 
Tyrell glanced at the bag and shook his head. "I don't really need the manual. I'll just look up the instructions online. Can’t wait to get this thing in the air."
 
Ricky nodded. "Yeah, drones can be a lot of fun. I hope you enjoy it. It's good to see people your age interested in something other than their phones." Tyrell laughed and handed over the money and thanked Ricky again before heading back to his car. As he pulled out of the parking lot, his mind raced to all of the places that he could probably fly this thing. He looked at his cellphone and noticed that he had just enough time on his lunch break to go home, charge it up, and take it for a spin.
 
When he arrived at home, he rushed inside and plugged the drone into the charger. As he waited for it to charge, he decided to call his sister Janine to tell her about his newest gadget.
 
"Hey Janine, guess what I just bought?" Tyrell said as he answered the phone.
 
"Hold on. Tyrell, what did you say to your momma?" Janine asked with a hint of annoyance in her voice that caught Tyrell off guard, he paused for a moment to get his thoughts together.
 
"Oh, I just told her that I was going to be able to provide for my family better than she ever did. I didn't mean to hurt her feelings, I just wanted to make it clear that I'm not going to be struggling like she did, you know?" Tyrell replied, trying to brush off the comment.
 
"Oh my god Tyrell, I can't with you. You can't talk to your Momma like that. She did the best she could with what she had. And besides, what are you even talking about? You're not even married yet, you don't have a family to provide for," Janine said, her voice growing stern.
 
"Yeah, I don't. But I have a great job and someone who loves me and when we have a family together we won't ever live in an apartment with no room to grow. A family should live in a house with a yard. Every kid deserves that right?" looking at the timer on his phone. "Look, my lunch break is almost up, and I have something I want to do. I'll see you when you come home."
 
"Tyrell, you sleep in my second guest room. That bed is the same one I had when you were born and I was 10. What are you even talking about?" Janine asked, clearly annoyed. "You know, every parent wants to see their child have a better life than they had, right?
 
"Yeah, I know, but I just don't want to end up like her, struggling and barely making ends meet. I want to be able to give my kids the best life possible," Tyrell replied, his frustration clear in his voice.
 
"Okay, so let's say you and your girlfriend have a child that grows up to be the next Charles Saphire or whatever. He becomes super rich and lives in a mansion, and you still living in this house with a yard." Janine said, "Do you think it's fair for him to look at you and be like, 'That's my father and he lives in a tiny house, I will never raise my family in a place like that.'
 
Tyrell sighed, "I just want to do the best I can and provide for whatever family we end up having."
 
c
 
Tyrell thought for a moment before responding, "Yeah, I hear you Janine."  He paused for another few moments before speaking again. "I have to go."
 
"Alright, Tyrell. I love you," Janine said before hanging up the phone.
 
As Tyrell hung up the phone, he sighed and tried to shake off the frustration of the conversation. Despite being half brother and sister, Janine and Tyrell were very close and had a strong bond. Janine's real mother had passed away years ago, and she had grown very close to Tyrell's mother, who had become like a mother figure to her.
 
Tyrell had always had a complicated relationship with his mother, and he knew that he had a tendency to speak before he thought things through, which sometimes made things worse.
 
He turned his attention back to the drone, which had finished charging. He grabbed the remote control and headed out to the backyard to test it out.
 
As he flew the drone over his sister's garden, he couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and accomplishment. This was something he had always wanted, and now it was finally in his hands.
 
But as he flew the drone higher and higher, he started to lose control. It flew over the fence and into the neighbor's yard. Tyrell panicked as he tried to regain control, but it was too late. The drone crashed into his neighbor's tree.
Tyrell couldn't believe it. He knew he had to get it down before someone saw it and called the police. He quickly made his way over to the neighbors house to knock on the front door.
 
As he approached the front porch, he heard a woman's voice from inside the house.
 
"Don't come any closer or I'm calling the police!" the muffled voice yelled from behind the door.
 
"I'm sorry ma'am, I just crashed my drone in your tree and I'm trying to get it," Tyrell called back, taking a single step forward trying to make sure that he could hear him.
 
Inside the house the woman was having none of it. She whispered to the 911 operator, "There's an intruder at my door. Please send someone right away.  He’s Black with dreadlocks and he looks very dangerous."
 
"Ma'am, please, I'm not trying to break into your house. I just crashed my drone in your tree and I'm trying to get it," Tyrell said, his hands raised in surrender.
 
"I'm not trying to hurt you, lady. I just want to get my drone out of your back yard. Please, just let me get it and I'll be out of your yard," Tyrell pleaded, trying to calm her down.
 
There was no response and he was pretty sure she had just called the police. Tyrell knew he had to act fast. He couldn't let the police arrive and see him in the neighbor's yard. He decided to jump the fence and retrieve the drone before the police arrived. 
Walking toward the side of his neighbor’s house, he checked the timer one last time and realized he needed to hurry back to work soon or he’d be late.  As he approached the fence, he noticed that the lock was slightly open. Without thinking, he grabbed the latch and pulled it open, slipping through the gap. He knew he shouldn't be trespassing, but he couldn't leave the drone in the tree.
 
Tyrell's heart raced as he walked towards the tree, the sound of approaching sirens causing panic to set in. He knew he had to come up with a plan, and leaving the drone in the tree and running wasn't an option. He had to be able to show the police where it was in the tree and explain the situation.
 
Tyrell frantically shuffled around the tree, his eyes locked on the treetop desperately looking for the drone. He initially hoped to get it and get out of there before the police arrived, but it was probably too late for that now. The sirens sounded very close. Then they stopped.
 
He had an idea. He pulled out his phone and launched the drone's app, praying it would help him locate the device hidden in the tree up there. When the live feed from the drone's camera appeared on his screen, he saw himself in the frame. His heart sank as he realized the drone was perched near the top of the tree, out of reach.
 
Suddenly, two officers burst into the yard, guns drawn. Tyrell froze, his hands raised to surrender. One hand holding the drone controller and the other holding his cellphone.
 
"Don't move! Hands in the air! Turn around!" he heard a voice shout from behind him.
 
Tyrell put his hands up in the air as he turned around to face the officers, the drone remote clutched tightly in his hand. He knew this all looked bad, but he also knew he needed to show the police that it was just a remote control, then they would understand he wasn’t a burglar. He shouted out to them, explaining that he had just crashed his drone in the tree and was trying to retrieve it. But Tyrell's attempts to explain himself were drowned out by the officers' yelling, making it impossible for them to hear him clearly.
 
He knew he had to stay calm, but the sight of the guns pointed at him was overwhelming. What if he showed them his drone controller?
 
"Please! I'm not a criminal. I’m on my lunch break. Look. Here is the controller for it" Tyrell pleaded, his voice shaking with fear as he held up the remote control, trying to show them it was harmless. Suddenly, he heard the sound of gunfire and a sharp pain in his chest.  Tyrell crumpled to the ground and took his last breath as he heard Officer Headly say, "Oh my god, what have I done?", his voice shaking with panic as he looked down at the now lifeless body of Tyrell Lober.
 
Officer Headly could barely process what had just happened, his mind racing with fear and guilt..
 
"My god." Oliver said, shaking his head in frustration.
 
“He had a weapon, I had to defend myself,” Officer Headly stuttered, his face pale with shock.
 
“That's a goddamn game controller, you idiot! My god,” Officer Oliver said, shaking his head in frustration.
 
After looking around cautiously for a moment Officer Oliver grabs Officer Headly by the face and forces him look into his eyes "He had a weapon, you had to defend yourself. Okay? Unless you want to spend 20 years in jail. Say it with me." Officer Oliver whispered sharply, his voice cold and stern.
 
"He had a weapon, I had to defend myself," Headly repeated, his voice shaking with panic and fear.
 
"Good. Now remember that, and stick to it. We'll say he was reaching for a weapon and that's why you had to shoot. Got it?" Oliver said, letting go of Headly's face and stepping back.
 
"Y-yeah, I got it," Headly stuttered, still looking shaken. “But, a weapon?"
 
"Yes! Look at him. We'll say he was reaching for a weapon. That's all we need. I've been in this game a long time. Headly, you just stick to the story and we'll be fine. " Officer Oliver said, pulling a dirty gun from his ankle holster, “Now just grab the game controller and put it in the car. I'll call this in," Oliver said, pulling out his radio and calling for backup.


As Headly was about to run to the car, a loud alarm began to blare from Tyrell's body. 

Officer Oliver quickly whispered in a cold and stern tone, "Headly grab the controller, put it in the car.  Now, let it go off, what’s wrong with you." as he pulled a gun from his ankle holster and placed it in Tyrell’s hand.

Headly, still in shock, did as he was told. As the sirens grew louder and the sound of approaching police cars filled the air, the two officers quickly moved to alter the scene to make it look like Tyrell had been reaching for a weapon.
The sirens grew louder and the sound of approaching police cars filled the air. They had just finished when the first squad car pulled up.


Officer Oliver stepped forward to meet the officers, his face a perfect mask of calm. He recited the story they had concocted and the officers nodded, taking in the scene. As they began to disperse, Oliver and Headly silently looked at each other. 


Without saying a word to each they both knew that the truth would probably eventually come out, but Officer Oliver was confident that with the story they had constructed and a good lawyer they would get away with at least a slap on the wrist. 


For now, it was time to go. As they walked away from the scene, the blaring siren of the alarm that had long since stopped was  still ringing in their ears, neither of them said a word, but both knew that there was no turning back.

I Deserve Better Chapter 2
Janine Lober sat at her desk, staring at the computer screen in front of her. She was a tall, curvy Black girl with a wild afro and a passion for graphic design. As a recent graduate of a historically black college, she was very active in the online community where she would design memes and create graphics, promoting her school, Florida Technical University.  She had landed her dream job at a local design agency and was quickly making a name for herself in the office.


But all of that was pushed to the back of her mind as her phone rang, interrupting her work. She quickly answered, recognizing the number as one of her neighbors.


"Hey, Janine, it's Mrs. Johnson. I wanted to let you know that there's been a shooting in the neighborhood. I saw the police and the news crews outside. I hope everything is okay," the older woman's voice was filled with concern.


Janine's heart sank as she heard the words. She knew that the shooting was probably related to her brother, Tyrell. She quickly thanked Mrs. Johnson and hung up the phone, her mind racing.


She couldn't focus on work anymore. She needed to find out what had happened to Tyrell and make sure that the truth was told.


Janine quickly grabbed her bag and headed out of the office, ignoring the concerned calls from her coworkers. She drove to her neighborhood, her mind a whirlwind of emotions. As she pulled up to her street, she saw the flashing lights of police cars and the throngs of reporters crowding the sidewalks.


She parked her car and made her way through the crowd, her heart pounding in her chest. She finally reached the house at the center of the commotion, where she saw Tyrell's car parked on the curb. Her heart dropped as she saw the blood stains on the pavement next to it.


She pushed her way through the crowd and approached the police officer in charge. "What happened here? That's my brother's car. I need to know what happened to him," she said, her voice shaking with emotion.


The officer hesitated, clearly uncomfortable with her questioning. "Ma'am, we believe that your brother was attempting to break into this house when he was shot by one of our officers," he said, avoiding her gaze.


Janine's blood boiled with anger and frustration. She knew that Tyrell would never break into a house and she had just spoken to him.
She knew that the officer was lying.
Without another word, she turned and walked away, her mind racing with thoughts of justice and revenge. She couldn't let this injustice go unchallenged.
As she walked back to her car, she pulled out her phone and opened up her social media apps. She knew that the only way to get the truth out there was to use the power of the internet.
She quickly typed out a post, her fingers shaking with anger and grief. "My brother Tyrell did not deserve to die. He was a good person and a loving brother. I will not let his death be in vain. #IDeserveBetter"
She hit the post button and watched as the post quickly gained traction on social media. People all over the city began to share the post, expressing their condolences and support for Tyrell and his family.
Janine knew that she had to keep the momentum going. She began to design shirts with the hashtag #IDeserveBetter emblazoned on the front. She posted pictures of the shirts on social media and encouraged people to wear them in support of Tyrell and the movement.
As the hashtag gained traction, more and more people began to share their stories of injustice and police brutality. Janine was flooded with messages from people all over the country, expressing their support for the movement.
The hashtag began to trend nationally and soon, it was being featured on news outlets and talked about on talk shows. Janine's simple post had sparked a nationwide movement.
The movement was not just about Tyrell or his death, it was about the countless other people who had been killed by the police and the injustice that they had suffered. It was about the fact that nobody deserved to be treated that way and that the world deserved better.
Janine knew that the movement was just getting started and that there was still a long way to go. But she was determined to see it through, for Tyrell and for all of the people who deserved better.
The hashtag had become the catalyst for a nationwide movement, but Janine knew that it was the people, who had shared their stories and supported each other, that had made it possible.
Hashtags don't start movements, people do.
Janine's activism was rooted in her time in college, where she had been an active member of the Black Student Union. She had always been passionate about social justice, and her brother's death had only strengthened her resolve to fight for change.
As the movement gained momentum, Janine organized a peaceful protest with the slogan "I Deserve Better" to demand justice for Tyrell and all the other victims of police brutality. She designed shirts with the message for the protesters to wear and the phrase "I Deserve Better" quickly became a symbol of the movement.
The protest was a success, and the media coverage helped to spread the message of the movement even further. Janine's simple yet impactful slogan had ignited a fierce social media campaign for justice, with people proudly wearing the message on their clothing and seeking to get involved in the movement.
As the movement continued to grow, Janine knew that there was still much work to be done. But she also knew that with the support of the people and the determination to fight for what was right, they could make a difference.
The hashtag heard around the world, #IDeserveBetter, had become a nationwide phenomenon, nearly overnight. But Janine knew that it was the people behind the hashtag that would ultimately bring about the change they deserved.




Charges


Defense Arguments for Officer Oliver:


1. Officer Oliver did not fire the shots that led to Tyrell's death; Officer Headly did. Therefore, Oliver should not be charged for the shooting itself.
2. Oliver can claim that he genuinely believed Tyrell was holding a weapon based on the information he had at the time, which led to him supporting Officer Headly's claim of self-defense.
3. The drone itself could indeed be argued as a potentially dangerous device, which when operated unlawfully, poses a risk to public safety. Oliver may not have recognized it as a drone controller, which could have contributed to misunderstanding the situation.
4. Oliver's actions were based on his attempt to protect a fellow officer who he believed had made an honest mistake and panicked, not necessarily to cover up intentional wrongdoing.
5. Officer Oliver may argue that there were no clear and sensible alternatives to deal with the situation and protect Officer Headly from what he perceived were unfair consequences.
6. Oliver could argue that the responsibility to assess the situation should have been on the responding officers (the backup that was called) and that his judgment was clouded due to the pressure of witnessing a fellow officer involved in a shooting.
7. If prior instances of excessive force or biased behavior by Officer Oliver can't be established, the defense could argue that his actions in this single event are not indicative of a pattern of misconduct or criminal intent.
8. Oliver's position as a senior officer could be used to argue that his actions were influenced by a sense of responsibility for the well-being of his subordinates, and he believed he was acting in their best interest.
9. Oliver can argue that the police department's training methods did not prepare him for effectively dealing with a situation like this, and thus, his actions were a result of what he believed to be the best course of action under the circumstances.
10. The defense could claim that Oliver was acting in good faith under the belief that the legal system would ultimately uncover the truth, and thus, his involvement in the coverup was not an intentional act to deceive or obstruct justice.


Potential Charges Against Officer Oliver:


1. Obstruction of justice: For altering the scene to support Officer Headly's self-defense claim.
2. Tampering with evidence: For placing the gun in Tyrell's hand and instructing Officer Headly to take the controller.
3. Accessory after the fact: For helping Officer Headly cover up the shooting by orchestrating the false narrative.
4. Falsifying a police report: For providing a fabricated account of the incident.
5. Official misconduct: For using his position as an officer to protect Officer Headly from facing the consequences of the shooting, rather than pursuing the truth and upholding the law.
6. Conspiracy: For working alongside Officer Headly to create a false narrative and cover up the shooting.
7. Violation of Tyrell's civil rights: By not providing proper assistance and failing to respect his life and safety.
8. Aiding and abetting perjury: For encouraging Officer Headly to provide false testimony regarding the events that led to the shooting.


While these charges relate to Officer Oliver's potential liability in this situation, it should be noted that each jurisdiction's specific statutes and laws may vary, and the ultimate decision to charge an individual will be determined by the local prosecutor's office.




I Deserve Better Chapter 3
The courtroom was packed as the trial of Officer Oliver began and the gallery was filled with members of the community, many of whom had joined Janine's political movement "I Deserve Better" after the drone footage of the police framing Tyrell was released to the public. Some of them held signs with slogans such as "Justice for Tyrell" and "Stop Police Brutality.” but many of them worse black shirts with 3 words, ‘I Deserve Better’.

The room was buzzing with anticipation as the jury was sworn in and the attorneys made their opening statements.  The defense team, led by the skilled and charismatic Andrew Caravasos, had meticulously prepared their case, leaving no stone unturned in their effort to clear Officer Oliver's name. Andrew Caravasos hired a team of social media experts to investigate Tyrell's online presence, where he mentions a ‘12 gauge shotgun with Magical bullets’.


Andrew began his opening statement with a bang, "Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, let me be clear, my client, Officer Oliver, did not murder Tyrell Lober. He is not on trial for that. He is on trial for planting evidence and falsely accusing a deceased individual of a crime. And I can assure you, by the end of this trial, you will see that my client is innocent of these accusations. We will prove that Tyrell Lober was in possession of an illegal weapon and that Officer Oliver had no motive to frame him. We will show that Officer Oliver was simply doing his job and trying to keep the community safe."


Andrew then began to pace back and forth in front of the jury box, making eye contact with each juror as he spoke, "The prosecution will try to paint my client as a villain, but I assure you, he is not. He is a dedicated public servant who has devoted his life to protecting this community. He made a split-second decision in a high-stress situation and unfortunately, it resulted in a tragic outcome. But that does not make him guilty of the charges against him."


As Andrew sat down, the prosecutor, Holley Lawrence, stood up to give her opening statement. "Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this is a case about integrity and justice. The defendant, Officer Oliver, not only planted evidence on a deceased individual, but he also participated in a cover-up that resulted in the death of an innocent man. The defendant's actions were a violation of Tyrell Lober's civil rights and a betrayal of the community's trust. We will prove that the defendant not only planted the weapon, but also coached his partner to lie about the events that led to Tyrell Lober's death."


She then walked closer to the jury, her voice becoming more passionate, "We will also present evidence that the defendant had a history of misconduct and a pattern of using excessive force. This is not a case of a split-second decision, this is a case of a corrupt officer using his power to abuse the justice system. We will also introduce evidence that Tyrell Lober was an upstanding member of the community, with no criminal history and had no weapon on him. We will prove that the defendant framed him, and that is why he is guilty of all the charges against him."


Holley Lawrence then walked back to her table, and with a determined look, "Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, we ask you to keep an open mind and consider all of the evidence presented before making a decision. My client is Officer Headler and we will prove it. Thank you."
