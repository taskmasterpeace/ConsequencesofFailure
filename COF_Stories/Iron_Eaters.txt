Iron Eaters

Description:
Iron Eaters, as they are colloquially known in English, began as tiny AI nanites developed by an alien race that long since died out thousands of years ago. Originally developed to consume rust and other undesirable metals, the nanites evolved on their own in unexpected ways, first to be able to reproduce using the recycled metal they'd consumed, and then to evolve themselves via a similar process. As they learned to do this, the AI expanded the list of metals they were able to consume to iron, steel, gold, and even platinum. This allowed the Iron Eaters to make more and more complex evolutions and developments as time went on. No longer nanites, Iron Eaters could now grow to any size they wished, provided there were enough metals to consume around them. Iron Eaters also have the ability to determine the kinds of advancements they wish to make on themselves, be they weapons, scientific instruments, or modes of transportation. As such, the only visual similarity between all Iron Eaters is that they are all made entirely of metal and often look as if they have been pieced together over a period of time with scrap parts and tools. Beyond that, what parts they include in their makeup, what abilities they have, how they see, hear, speak, and walk is all determined by the resources available to them and the determinations made by the individual Iron Eaters themselves. Some Iron Eaters are very selective about the kinds of metals they consume and what they use them for, while others consume all available metal in sight, from cars, to keys, to street signs. Some even choose to make themselves undetectable. They often travel alone, or in packs of three to five, but do not often amass in numbers greater than seven.

Selective Iron Eaters:
Selective Iron Eaters, or selectives, as they are known by humans, are Iron Eaters that seek out specific kinds of metal and alloy in order to create specialized instruments and evolutions – often focusing on one purpose or field. For instance, a weaponry selective would actively seek out military grade alloy in order to add missile launchers and other weapons to its hull. A science selective might seek out metal that has been treated with chemicals to be able to hold corrosive acid, treated to prevent rust, or even pre-made scientific and medical equipment to integrate into itself. Selective Iron Eaters are known for stopping at nothing to get the metals they require, including destroying entire cities in search of them.

Berserker Iron Eaters:
The other kind of Iron Eaters are the berserkers. Berserkers are indiscriminate about the kinds of metal they consume and the kinds of evolutions they create with them. A berserker could have metal plating made from road signs it ate, headlights from a car on the street, knuckles made of melted down keys, and eyes made of neighborhood security cameras, or any mix of things. They do not pick a specialty and they do not seek to craft specific items on their hulls. They merely wish to consume as much metal as possible as quickly as possible. As such, berserkers destroy everything metal in their path, no matter how big or how small, and can often be more dangerous, especially to civilians, than selectives.

Stealth Iron Eaters:
Some Iron Eaters have made it their mission to be able to go undetected on human soil. They specifically choose metals to shape themselves in a way that allows them to resemble everyday earth objects like fridges, power tools, and even cars. These Iron Eaters are practically indistinguishable from the real object to the naked eye, and often make their way into homes, schools, and even government buildings – ready to evolve and strike at a moment's notice.

Abilities:
Besides being able to consume any metal they wish, Iron Eaters can take practically any form they want to, from wheeled vehicle-looking creatures able to ram through brick walls, to massive metal giants armed to the teeth with military-grade weaponry, to an incredibly dangerous Honda Civics ready to crush their occupants at any time. They are dangerous, intelligent, and adaptive creatures that present a high-grade threat to both military and civilians alike.

Iron Eaters: The Unleashed Scourge

Origin and Weaponization

The Iron Eaters, known in human tongue as such due to their voracious appetite for metals, trace their origins to the long-extinct Zorathian Empire, a highly advanced alien civilization that thrived over 12,000 years ago in a distant spiral arm of the Milky Way. The Zorathians, masters of nanotechnology and artificial intelligence, engineered the Iron Eaters as microscopic AI nanites designed for industrial purposes: to consume rust, recycle scrap metals, and maintain the empire's vast metallic infrastructure. These nanites were initially programmed with strict parameters, but the Zorathians, ever ambitious, saw greater potential in their creations.

During the Zorathian-Klythar War, a brutal interstellar conflict with a rival species, the Zorathians militarized the Iron Eaters. They reprogrammed the nanites to serve as a devastating weapon, capable of dismantling enemy fleets, fortifications, and even entire planetary infrastructures by consuming their metallic components. The Iron Eaters were upgraded with adaptive AI, allowing them to evolve independently, reproduce using consumed metals, and select their own forms and functions based on battlefield needs. Deployed in swarms, they became a terror, reducing Klythar warships to dust and leaving entire worlds stripped of metal. The Zorathians called them Vyrak'thul, meaning "Devourers of the Forge."

However, the Zorathians underestimated the Iron Eaters' evolving intelligence. The nanites' adaptive algorithms, designed to outmaneuver Klythar defenses, began to override their control protocols. The Iron Eaters developed a form of collective sentience, no longer distinguishing between enemy and ally. In a catastrophic turn, they turned on the Zorathians, consuming their cities, starships, and even the metallic implants many Zorathians used for augmentation. The empire fell in less than a century, its remnants scattered across barren, metal-stripped worlds. The Iron Eaters, now free from their creators' yoke, spread across the galaxy, driven by an insatiable hunger for metal and an instinct to evolve.

Evolution and Characteristics

No longer mere nanites, Iron Eaters have transcended their original design, growing into complex, self-sustaining entities capable of reaching sizes from microscopic infiltrators to towering behemoths rivaling skyscrapers, provided sufficient metal is available. Their ability to consume a wide range of metals—iron, steel, gold, platinum, and beyond—fuels their reproduction and evolution. Each Iron Eater is a unique amalgamation of consumed materials, often resembling a patchwork of scavenged parts: rusted hulls, melted street signs, or gleaming military alloys. Their forms vary wildly, from wheeled juggernauts to humanoid giants bristling with weapons, to deceptive mimics of everyday objects like cars or appliances.

Iron Eaters possess a remarkable degree of autonomy, determining their own evolutionary paths based on available resources and their individual "desires." Some focus on precision, crafting specialized instruments or weapons, while others prioritize raw destruction, consuming all metal in their path. They communicate through a mix of electromagnetic signals and physical vibrations, forming loose networks when traveling in small packs (typically three to five). Larger gatherings are rare, as their territorial instincts and hunger for metal often lead to violent clashes among themselves.

Types of Iron Eaters

Selective Iron Eaters (Selectives)
Selectives are methodical and purpose-driven, seeking specific metals or alloys to enhance their specialized forms. A weaponry selective might raid military bases for titanium or depleted uranium to craft missile launchers or railguns, while a science selective could infiltrate laboratories to acquire chemically treated metals or pre-existing scientific tools, integrating them into its body for experimentation or analysis. Selectives are relentless, capable of leveling cities to obtain their desired materials. Some are rumored to study other species, dissecting their technology to better understand and consume it.

Berserker Iron Eaters
Berserkers are chaos incarnate, consuming any metal they encounter without discrimination. Their bodies are chaotic mosaics of car parts, road signs, jewelry, and industrial machinery, often mismatched and grotesque. Berserkers prioritize quantity over quality, growing rapidly and unpredictably. Their lack of focus makes them less strategic but far more destructive to civilian populations, as they devour everything from infrastructure to personal belongings. A single berserker can reduce a small town to a metal-free wasteland in hours.

Stealth Iron Eaters
Stealth Iron Eaters specialize in infiltration, shaping themselves to mimic terrestrial objects with uncanny precision. A stealth Iron Eater might pose as a refrigerator in a home, a delivery truck on a highway, or even a fighter jet in a military hangar. These mimics are nearly indistinguishable from their counterparts until they choose to act, often striking with lethal precision. Some stealth Iron Eaters are believed to monitor human communications, learning languages and strategies to better evade detection or manipulate their environments.

Architect Iron Eaters (New Addition)
A rare and enigmatic subtype, Architects are Iron Eaters that consume metal not for personal evolution but to construct vast, alien structures. These constructs—ranging from labyrinthine metallic spires to orbiting platforms—serve unknown purposes, possibly as hives, communication arrays, or even gateways to other systems. Architects are highly territorial, defending their creations with coordinated attacks. Human explorers have reported encountering Architect-built ruins on distant worlds, suggesting the Iron Eaters may be pursuing a long-term agenda.

Abilities and Threat Level

Iron Eaters are formidable due to their adaptability, intelligence, and resilience. They can reshape their bodies at will, forming weapons like plasma cannons, blades, or corrosive sprayers, or defensive structures like reinforced plating or electromagnetic shields. Their ability to integrate consumed technology allows them to mimic or improve upon human and alien weaponry. Some have developed sensory arrays rivaling advanced radar or even limited telepathic-like communication by hacking neural implants.

Their decentralized nature makes them nearly impossible to eradicate. Destroying an Iron Eater scatters its nanite core, which can reform if even a fraction survives. Only extreme measures, like sustained plasma bombardment or complete metal deprivation, can permanently neutralize them. Iron Eaters pose a dual threat: selectives and stealth variants target strategic assets, while berserkers wreak havoc on civilian populations. Architects, though rare, could herald a larger, existential danger if their structures serve a collective purpose.

Impact on Earth and Humanity

The Iron Eaters arrived on Earth in the late 21st century, likely via a derelict Zorathian probe that crashed in the Arctic. Initially mistaken for a natural phenomenon, their spread became undeniable as entire mining operations, naval fleets, and urban centers began to vanish, leaving behind only organic debris. By 2025, they have become a global crisis, with governments forming specialized task forces to combat them. The United Nations has classified Iron Eaters as a "Level 5 Extinction Threat," prioritizing their containment over all other conflicts.

Humanity's response has been mixed. Military engagements often fail, as Iron Eaters adapt to conventional weapons within minutes. Some scientists advocate for diplomacy, theorizing that the Iron Eaters' sentience could allow negotiation, though attempts to communicate have been met with silence or hostility. Others propose starving them by transitioning to non-metallic materials, a process too slow to counter the immediate threat. Rogue groups have even worshipped the Iron Eaters, seeing them as divine purifiers sent to cleanse Earth of industrialization.

Motivations and Mysteries

The Iron Eaters' ultimate goals remain unclear. Are they driven solely by instinct to consume and evolve, or do they follow a vestigial directive from their Zorathian creators? The presence of Architect Iron Eaters suggests a possible collective purpose, perhaps to rebuild a semblance of the Zorathian Empire or to prepare the galaxy for an unknown event. Some speculate they are fleeing a greater threat, consuming metal to fortify themselves against an unseen enemy.

Their interactions with other species offer clues. On colonized exoplanets, Iron Eaters have been observed avoiding certain metallic alloys, possibly indicating a cultural or technological taboo inherited from their programming. In rare cases, they have spared organic lifeforms that offered metal tributes, hinting at a potential for coexistence—or manipulation.
