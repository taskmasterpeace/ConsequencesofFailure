NARRATOR: 
Welcome to Eyes & Ears Radio where we explore the stories of the world's most fascinating people. Today we're speaking with Mrs. Juwariyah Dantata, a former receptionist at the airport for chartered helicopters in Nigeria. She shares with us her interactions with the now world famous Mr. Kieser Eziobi, who was her boss is that correct Mrs. Dantata?






MRS. DANTATA: 
Yes, that's correct. I only knew him before he became who he is now.






NARRATOR: 
And can you tell us a little bit about what he was like?






MRS. DANTATA: 
He was always very polite and professional. But he was also very private. I never really knew much about him, even though we worked together for a many months.






NARRATOR: 
Do you remember anything specific about him that you can share with us?






MRS. DANTATA: 
There was one time when he had to fly to a nearby city for a meeting. But there was a storm brewing and the airport was closed. So he chartered a helicopter and flew himself there. I remember being very impressed by that.






NARRATOR: 
Thank you for sharing that Mrs. Dantata. I do not mean to be disrespectful but you are a beautiful woman-






MRS. DANTATA: 
Thank you.






NARRATOR: 
-and Mr. Eziobi was not a married man, to your knowledge-






MRS. DANTATA: 
No, he wasn't.






NARRATOR:
-So I have to ask, did you ever, uh, consider, you know, pursuing something more with him?






MRS. DANTATA: 
You do not have to ask. But of course I did. But he was my boss and I didn't want to risk losing my job. But there was one time I came to work and he had flowers for me. I was so surprised and touched. But he never said anything about it and we never spoke of it again.






NARRATOR: 
That is so interesting. Did he ever give any indication that he might have had feelings for you as well?






MRS. DANTATA: 
Wait. I found out weeks later that the reason he gave me flowers was because my sister had died. He had seen me crying in the break room and he wanted to comfort me. But he never said anything because he didn't want to make things awkward between us.






NARRATOR: 
That is just so beautiful and sad at the same time. What a complicated man he must have been.






MRS. DANTATA: 
Yes, he was. But I think that's what makes him so special.






NARRATOR: 
Thank you so much for sharing your story with us, Mrs. Dantata. It was truly-






MRS. DANTATA: 
You're welcome.






NARRATOR: 
Thank you. And we hope you'll join us
