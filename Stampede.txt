END








The story opens with our protagonist, Stampede, a man who has a gravitational field manipulation ability as he infiltrates a police station. He systematically eliminates every officer in the building, using his unique ability to take them down. He then proceeds to do the same to other police stations leaving a trail of destruction in his wake. After mounting an ineffective response, the authorities are unable to stop him, and as the body count rises. They are forced to turn to recently retired police detective and grizzled old-timer Franz Escobar.


Franz is reluctant to return to the force but he agrees to take on the case. He quickly realizes that he is up against a very powerful and dangerous opponent. As he delves deeper into the investigation, Franz discovers that there is more to Stampede, aka John Rivers that meets the eye. He learns that John is on a mission to destroy the corrupt police force that killed his sister. Franz begins to sympathize with John, and he starts to wonder if maybe he is on the wrong side.


When the newspapers get a hold of the story, they start calling him "The Stampede", and the city is plunged into chaos with many siding with Stampede's cause of anti-police corruption. In a voice over from the Stampede, describing his disdain for the Los Angeles Police Department and his determination to take them down. He explains that he knows their techniques and tactics and that he has no fear of death. He then goes on to describe his abilities, including gravitational field manipulation which he will use to take down the LAPD.  And when he is finished with the LAPD he is coming for the NYPD to convict the guilty. He called himself Justice.


The detective, a grizzled old-timer Franz, isn't afraid of a fight but soon finds himself up against one of the most powerful living super-weapons in the country. John is smarter, faster, and more ruthless than anyone the detective has ever dealt with. The police are completely unprepared for the level of violence and destruction that the protagonist is capable of, and soon the city is plunged into chaos. But the detective is not about to give up, and he will stop at nothing to put an end to the killing spree.


As the film progresses, it becomes clear that the protagonist is not just out for revenge, but is also trying to expose the corruption in the LAPD.

Why did they choose to kill her with a car bomb?


The friends in high places chose to kill Rebecca with a car bomb because they wanted to make it look like an accident.


Suggestions:


#1 Instead of a car bomb.  Another idea that could be just as effective from a dramatic standpoint would be for the friends in high places to hire a professional assassin to kill Rebecca. This would add an element of suspense and make the story more exciting.

2. they plant false evidence to make it look like an accident. 
3. They bribe someone to take the fall for the murder

3. The professional assassin makes his move and kills Rebecca. 
4. The professional assassin makes it look like an accident. 
5. The professional assassin leaves the scene and is never seen or heard from again. 


#2 The False Evidence


1. The friends in high places plant false evidence to make it look like an accident. 
2. The false evidence is discovered by the police. 
3. The police investigate the false evidence and determine that it was planted. 
4. The friends in high places are never discovered and the case remains unsolved.

________________


As the former closing shift supervisor at the Los Angeles Police Academy Firearms Department, Dave Wilkerson had seen it all. A highly skilled and experienced soldier with a spotless record, he was respected and admired by his peers. But Wilkerson's career took a turn when he was suspended for insubordination after a heated altercation with a superior officer.


Rookie cop Brian Kegan was brought in to fill Wilkerson's shift until his suspension ended, but what he discovered would change the course of his career. While filling in, Kegan discovered that boxes meant to contain guns were empty and filled with seemingly random gun parts. What a blunder.


Upon further investigation, Kegan discovered that the valuable guns were missing and the least expensive guns were mislabeled or filled with random gun parts. It suddenly all looked deliberate and Kegan reached out to Police Chief Doug Allen for help.


When Kegan went to the police chief, Doug Allen, Allen brushed it off and told Kegan he would handle it, but he never did. Kegan, feeling like he had done his duty by alerting the chief, let it go.


Days later, Kegan was given an unexpected raise and transferred to a different district, effectively covering up the operation and leaving Kegan feeling like a pawn in the police department’s coverup.


Chief Allen's eagerness to ignore the issue and thank Kegan for staying quiet disturbed him. Despite his attempts to reassure himself that he had done his duty by informing the chief, he couldn't shake the feeling of uncertainty and doubt. Kegan questioned whether he would ever have the fortitude to stand up to corruption within the department again.
