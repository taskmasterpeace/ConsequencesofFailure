## CHAPTER ONE: RUSTY RICHARDS
### The Return

The re-entry capsule screamed through Earth's atmosphere like a wounded animal, trailing fire across the Australian sky.

Inside, strapped to a seat never meant for human occupancy, Rusty Richards pressed his palms against the viewport and watched his planet rush toward him. Home. The word felt foreign on his tongue, like a song he'd forgotten how to sing. Two years. Twenty-four months. Seven hundred and thirty days since the vortex had taken him from his yacht deck, champagne glass still warm in his hand, Sarah's perfume still lingering in his nostrils.

The capsule shuddered. Warning lights blinked angry red across alien instrumentation that he'd learned to read but never truly understand. The Grays had promised him a "controlled descent." Looking at the speedometer—if that's what the pulsing hexagonal display actually measured—Rusty thought their definition of "controlled" needed work.

His hands were shaking.

Not from fear. Fear he'd left behind somewhere between Jupiter and Mars, when the Gray named Kor-Thalen had shown him what was coming. No, his hands shook because in approximately four minutes, he would have to speak. He would have to find words for things that had no words. He would have to convince seven billion people that their world was about to end, and that a race of grey-skinned dimensional travelers had spent the last thousand years preparing humanity for a war most humans didn't believe could exist.

The altimeter—he was pretty sure it was an altimeter—plummeted. Outside, the fire gave way to clouds. The clouds gave way to green. Australia's northern territories spread beneath him like a vast emerald carpet, dotted with clusters of civilization that looked impossibly small, impossibly fragile.

Eight years. That's all they had. Eight years before the Alliance of Four arrived with their atmospheric processors and their world-breakers and their absolute certainty that Earth was a pollutant that needed to be sterilized.

Rusty closed his eyes and saw Kor-Thalen's face—those enormous black eyes that saw more than light, that looked through time itself and found him wanting. "You are the messenger," the Gray had said in that voice that wasn't quite sound, that resonated in the bones. "You will tell them. Most will not believe. That is expected. That is factored. But some will. And some is enough."

The capsule's parachute deployed with a crack that rattled Rusty's teeth. Deceleration crushed him into the alien seat, and for one horrifying moment, he was back in the vortex, tumbling through colors that shouldn't exist, watching his yacht shrink to a pinprick and vanish as reality unfolded around him like an origami flower made of nightmares.

Then: impact.

The capsule hit earth hard enough to rattle his brain in his skull. Something hissed—pressure equalization, he'd been told, nothing to worry about—and the viewport cracked in a spiderweb pattern that made the approaching crowd outside look like a Picasso painting.

People. There were people running toward him.

Rusty fumbled with the harness release. His hands wouldn't work properly. Simple things—buttons, latches—had become impossibly complex after two years of alien simplicity. The Grays didn't use physical controls. They thought at their machines, and the machines obeyed. They'd tried to explain how it worked, but Rusty's brain wasn't built for it. He was a musician, not a neuroscientist. He wrote songs about heartbreak and hope, not quantum entanglement and dimensional harmonics.

The hatch opened from outside. Daylight flooded in, brutally bright after the capsule's soft bioluminescence. Hands reached for him—human hands, blessedly familiar—and pulled him from the metal womb that had carried him home.

His legs gave out immediately.

The ground came up fast, but someone caught him. Voices surrounded him, a cacophony of questions and exclamations in Australian accents thick as honey. Where had he been? Was he hurt? How had he survived? My God, was that thing a spaceship?

Rusty tried to answer, but his mouth had forgotten English. Two years of Kor-Thalen's bone-language had rewired something in his brain. The words were there—he could feel them, taste them—but the connection between thought and speech had been severed like a telephone wire in a storm.

"Give him space!" A woman's voice, sharp with authority. The crowd pulled back, and Rusty found himself looking up at a police officer in a crisp uniform, her dark skin sheened with sweat in the Australian heat. "Sir, can you understand me? Do you speak English?"

"Yes," Rusty croaked. His first word in two years. It felt like victory.

The officer's radio squawked. She answered it without taking her eyes off Rusty. "Yes, ma'am. Confirming visual. White male, approximately thirty years old, appears malnourished but ambulatory. No visible injuries. The object he arrived in... I don't know what to call it, ma'am. It's unlike anything I've ever seen."

More vehicles were arriving. Rusty could hear the sirens, see the flashing lights painting the grass in alternating shades of red and blue. An ambulance. Military jeeps. A news van—no, three news vans. Word traveled fast in the age of smartphones. Of course it did. A fireball had crossed the sky in broad daylight and deposited an alien pod in a football field. Every person who'd seen it had probably already posted about it online.

Good, Rusty thought. Let them film this. Let them broadcast it. Eight years wasn't enough time for bureaucratic channels and government committees. The world needed to know now.

"Rusty Richards."

The words came from behind him. Rusty turned—too fast, the world spun—and found himself facing a man in an expensive suit that screamed "government official." American, judging by the flag pin on his lapel. Mid-fifties, silver hair, eyes like a shark evaluating whether you were food or competitor.

"I'm Deputy Director James Hartley, U.S. Department of Defense," the man said. His smile didn't reach his eyes. "Mr. Richards, I can't tell you how relieved we are to see you alive. Your family will be overjoyed."

Family. The word hit Rusty like a physical blow. Sarah. Emily. His mother in Portland. His father in Nashville. Two years for him, but also two years for them. Two years of not knowing. Two years of funerals without bodies, of hope slowly curdling into acceptance.

"I need to make a statement," Rusty said. His voice was getting stronger, the rust flaking off. "A public statement. International broadcast. As soon as possible."

Hartley's smile crystallized into something predatory. "Of course, of course. But first, we need to debrief you. Standard protocol for... well, for whatever this is. We have medical staff standing by, and I'm sure you'd like to speak with your family—"

"Eight years," Rusty interrupted. He met Hartley's shark-eyes with his own, and didn't flinch. "That's how long we have before the Alliance of Four arrives. Eight years to prepare for an invasion that will end every human life on this planet unless we fight back. Eight years to turn ordinary people into weapons capable of facing an enemy that considers us less than insects. I was taken by an alien race called the Grays specifically to deliver this message, and I will deliver it. Today. Now. With or without government cooperation."

The football field had gone silent. Everyone within earshot—police officers, paramedics, journalists, random civilians who'd seen the pod fall—stood frozen, staring at Rusty like he'd sprouted a second head.

Hartley's smile finally died. "Mr. Richards, you've been through a trauma. You need medical attention—"

"I need a microphone and a camera," Rusty said. He pointed at the news crews, already filming. "They have both. I'm going to walk over there right now and tell them everything. You can either help me do this properly, or you can watch me do it anyway while your government looks like it's trying to suppress information about an alien invasion. Your choice. You have thirty seconds."

The Deputy Director's jaw worked silently for a moment. Rusty could see the calculation happening behind those shark-eyes: risk assessment, political fallout, chain of command. Whatever Hartley saw in Rusty's face must have convinced him, because he finally nodded.

"Fine. But this goes through proper channels. I'll arrange a press conference in Derby—"

"No." Rusty was already walking toward the news vans, his legs remembering how to work with each step. "It happens here. It happens now. The Grays chose me because I have a platform. Because people know my music. Because when I speak, millions listen." He glanced back at Hartley. "They also chose me because I'm American, and they believed your government would try to control the message. They were right. But I'm not going to let that happen."

The journalists surged toward him like water breaking through a dam. Microphones thrust into his face. Cameras swung to capture his emaciated frame, his alien clothing, the silver capsule smoking quietly in the background. Questions bombarded him from every direction, but Rusty raised his hands and the crowd quieted. It was a trick he'd learned performing to stadium crowds: silence is louder than shouting.

"My name is Rusty Richards," he began, and his voice didn't shake. "Two years ago, I disappeared from my yacht during a party. Most of you probably assumed I'd fallen overboard drunk. Some thought I'd been kidnapped. A few conspiracy theorists suggested aliens. The conspiracy theorists were right."

Nervous laughter rippled through the crowd. Rusty didn't smile.

"I was taken by an alien species called the Grays. They've been observing humanity since before recorded history, studying us, waiting for us to reach a certain level of development. They took me to their base—I can't tell you where it is because the Grays exist partially outside our normal space-time, but I can tell you I saw things that will haunt me until the day I die."

He paused, gathering himself. The cameras never stopped rolling.

"In eight years, an armada will arrive at Earth. Four alien civilizations have formed an alliance called the Alliance of Four. Their mission is simple: they believe Earth is polluting local space with our electromagnetic emissions, our satellite debris, our nuclear tests. They've deemed us a contamination that needs to be cleansed. They will come with weapons we can't comprehend to terraform our atmosphere into something breathable for them and instantly lethal for us. Every human being will die. Every animal. Every plant. Earth will become an alien world, and our entire species will be erased from the universe."

Someone dropped a camera. It hit the ground with a crack that sounded like a gunshot.

"The Grays oppose this," Rusty continued. "They believe humanity has potential, that we deserve a chance to defend ourselves. So they've devised a plan. Starting soon—maybe it's already started—people around the world will begin to vanish. They'll disappear for weeks or months, taken to the Grays' dimensional space. When they return, they'll be changed. Enhanced. The Grays call them Living Superweapons. People with powers and knowledge beyond anything we've imagined. Physics-defying abilities. Instant expertise in fields they've never studied. Alien symbiotes that grant extraordinary capabilities."

A journalist found her voice. "You're saying aliens are going to start kidnapping people and turning them into superheroes?"

"I'm saying aliens are going to start recruiting soldiers for a war most of you don't believe can happen," Rusty corrected. "The Grays estimate they can enhance about one thousand humans before the Alliance arrives. One thousand weapons against an armada that's already destroyed six other species. Those aren't good odds."

"Why should we believe any of this?" Another voice, male, skeptical. "You could have been anywhere for two years. This could be a publicity stunt for a new album."

Rusty turned to the voice and locked eyes with a balding man holding a recorder. "Go ahead and think that. Most people will. The Grays predicted it. But in the coming weeks, people will start disappearing and reappearing with impossible abilities. Countries will begin militarizing these individuals. Conflicts will erupt over how to control them. And somewhere around Year Two or Three, someone will detect the Alliance of Four's armada entering our solar system, and you'll all realize I was telling the truth. I just hope that realization doesn't come too late."

"Mr. Richards!" A new voice, and Rusty turned to see a man in a suit pushing through the crowd—a different suit, younger, with a pin that marked him as United Nations. "If what you're saying is true, what should the international community do? What actions should we take?"

Finally, Rusty thought. The right question.

"Unite," he said simply. "In eight years, national borders won't matter. The Alliance doesn't care if you're American or Chinese or Nigerian or Indian. They're coming for all of us. We need a unified response. A global organization dedicated to researching these Living Superweapons, training them, preparing them. The Grays shared intelligence about the Alliance's weapons, their tactics, their weaknesses—yes, they have weaknesses. But that intelligence is useless if we spend the next eight years fighting each other instead of preparing for them."

"And who would lead such an organization?" the UN official asked.

Rusty shrugged. "I'm a musician. I write songs. I'm nobody's idea of a military commander. But I know someone who is." He looked directly at the camera, knowing that somewhere, somehow, Vaughn Galloway was watching. "And I'm betting he's already planning something."

The questions continued for another hour, but Rusty had said what he needed to say. The seed was planted. Now it just needed time to grow—eight years, to be precise. He allowed himself to be led to an ambulance, submitted to medical examination while journalists shouted questions at the windows, and waited for the inevitable.

Hartley appeared two hours later, after the doctors had declared Rusty malnourished but remarkably healthy considering his alleged ordeal. The Deputy Director's shark-smile was gone, replaced by something that might have been respect.

"That was quite a performance," Hartley said.

"It wasn't a performance," Rusty replied tiredly. "It was a warning."

"The President wants to speak with you. So does the UN Secretary-General. So do about forty heads of state and every major news network on the planet." Hartley pulled out a phone—Rusty stared at it; they'd gotten so much thinner in two years—and began scrolling through messages. "You've created quite a situation, Mr. Richards."

"Good. Situations demand action." Rusty leaned back against the ambulance's uncomfortable bench. "When can I see my family?"

"They're being flown to Darwin now. Should arrive within the hour." Hartley looked up from the phone. "Your girlfriend Sarah wants you to know she never stopped believing you were alive. Your sister Emily... well, she's got some choice words for you about the heart attack you gave your mother."

Despite everything, Rusty smiled. "Sounds like Emily."

"Before you see them, I need to ask: did the aliens give you anything? Any technology, any proof to back up your claims?"

Rusty shook his head. "The Grays said physical evidence would be confiscated or dismissed as fabrication. Better to let the evidence appear on its own when people start vanishing and returning with powers."

"Convenient," Hartley muttered.

"Strategic," Rusty corrected. "The Grays have been planning this for a long time. They know how humans think, how governments operate. They knew I'd be debriefed and detained and questioned. They knew you'd search the capsule and find nothing. They knew all of it. That's why they chose to send the message this way—public, immediate, impossible to suppress completely."

Hartley's phone buzzed. He glanced at it, and something in his expression shifted. "There's someone here who wants to see you. Says he's a friend."

The ambulance door opened, and Vaughn Galloway stepped inside.

Rusty had never met the man in person, but he'd recognize that silver-and-black hair anywhere. Every conspiracy theorist with an internet connection knew Vaughn Galloway: billionaire tech entrepreneur, UFO enthusiast, founder of a dozen companies that existed in that gray zone between legitimate science and fringe speculation. If there was a man on Earth who might actually believe Rusty's story, it was Vaughn.

"Mr. Richards," Galloway said, extending a hand. His grip was firm, his eyes sharp. "I apologize for the intrusion, but when I heard your press conference, I had to meet you immediately."

"You believe me," Rusty said. It wasn't a question.

"I've been waiting for something like this my entire life," Galloway replied. "Though I'll admit, I expected the aliens to be less helpful and more anal probe-y." His smile was brief, professional. "I've already begun preliminary work on a private organization dedicated to extraterrestrial threats. I was calling it FIST—First Infantry Strike Team. But after hearing your suggestion, I think SPEAR has a better ring to it. Special Personnel for Extraterrestrial Assault and Research."

"The government will fight you," Hartley warned.

"The government will cooperate with me," Galloway countered smoothly, "because they'll have no choice. When people start appearing with godlike powers, the military-industrial complex won't be able to contain them. Better to work with someone who understands the threat than to spend eight years playing jurisdictional games while Rome burns." He turned back to Rusty. "I need to know everything the Grays told you. Everything about the Alliance, about the Living Superweapons, about the invasion timeline. Will you work with me?"

Rusty studied the man who would become SPEAR's founder. Kor-Thalen had shown him this moment, had told him Vaughn Galloway was part of the plan. But the Gray had also warned him: "Trust is rare among humans. Choose your allies carefully. Not everyone who fights the Alliance fights for humanity's good."

Looking into Galloway's eyes, Rusty saw ambition, intelligence, and something else—something hungry. But he also saw determination. And eight years wasn't enough time to be picky about allies.

"I'll work with you," Rusty said. "On one condition: SPEAR answers to the world, not to one nation. Not to one corporation. If we're going to survive this, it has to be a truly global effort."

"Agreed," Galloway said without hesitation. "Though I should warn you, making that happen will be its own war."

"Better than the alternative."

Hartley's phone buzzed again, more insistently this time. The Deputy Director read the message and stood abruptly. "Your family's helicopter is landing. I'll give you privacy." He paused at the door. "Mr. Richards... I don't know if your story is true. But I hope to God it's not. Because if you're right, we're all in more trouble than we can imagine."

"We are," Rusty confirmed. "But we still have eight years. Eight years to prepare. Eight years to train. Eight years to become something more than what we are." He looked at Galloway. "Eight years to give humanity a fighting chance."

After Hartley left, Galloway pulled out a tablet—impossibly thin, like something out of a science fiction film—and began taking notes. "Walk me through the Alliance species. Start with their capabilities and work backward to their weaknesses."

But Rusty was no longer listening. Through the ambulance window, he could see a helicopter settling onto the football field, its rotors kicking up grass and dust. The side door opened, and Sarah jumped out before it had fully landed, her brown hair whipping in the downdraft, her face streaked with tears.

"We'll talk later," Rusty said to Galloway. "Right now, I need to see the people I left behind."

He stepped out of the ambulance on legs that felt like water, and Sarah crashed into him like a wave, her arms wrapping around him so tight he could barely breathe. She smelled like lavender and coffee and home. She was sobbing into his chest, saying his name over and over like a prayer.

Behind her, Emily emerged from the helicopter, moving slower, her eyes red but dry. She'd always been the strong one.

"You absolute bastard," Emily said when she reached him. Then she punched him in the shoulder—hard—and pulled him into a hug that made his ribs creak. "Two years, Rusty. Two years we thought you were dead."

"I'm sorry," he whispered. It was all he could say. "I'm so sorry."

"You're going to tell us everything," Emily said fiercely. "Every detail. Every moment. You're going to explain where you were and why you couldn't send word and why the hell you thought it was okay to come back talking about alien invasions on live television instead of calling your family first."

"I will," Rusty promised. "But first, I need you both to understand something." He pulled back enough to look at them both—Sarah and Emily, the two people who'd kept him human during those long months aboard the Gray vessel. "What I said in that press conference was true. All of it. In eight years, everything we know will end unless we fight. I need you to believe me."

Sarah touched his face gently, as if confirming he was real. "I believe you."

"I don't," Emily said bluntly. "But I believe that you believe it. So I'll listen."

It wasn't enough. But it was a start.

As the sun set over the Australian outback, painting the sky in shades of orange and purple that reminded Rusty painfully of the vortex, he sat with his family in a military facility and told them everything. About the Grays. About Kor-Thalen and the dimensional ship. About the Alliance of Four and their world-breakers and their absolute conviction that humanity was a disease to be eradicated.

And about the Living Superweapons that would soon begin appearing. The men and women who would be enhanced, transformed, weaponized. The powers they'd wield. The cost they'd pay.

"The Grays showed me the future," Rusty said as the night deepened outside. "Not the definite future—they said time is more flexible than we think—but a probable one. I saw Earth burning. I saw the sky turning red as our atmosphere was processed away. I saw the last humans choking on alien air, reaching for a sun they'd never see again."

He paused, looking at the faces of the women he loved.

"But I also saw another future. One where we fought back. Where these Living Superweapons stood against the Alliance and held the line long enough for humanity to evacuate. To survive. To scatter among the stars like seeds from a dying tree, carrying the memory of Earth into the cosmos."

"Which future happens?" Sarah asked quietly.

Rusty wished he had a better answer. "The Grays said it depends on the next eight years. On whether we can put aside our differences and unite against a common enemy. On whether the Living Superweapons can learn to work together instead of becoming weapons in human conflicts. On whether people like Vaughn Galloway can build something lasting instead of just profitable."

"That's a lot of ifs," Emily observed.

"It is," Rusty agreed. "But it's more than we had two years ago. Two years ago, the Alliance was coming and we had no idea. No warning. No chance. Now we have both. It's not much, but it's something."

Emily leaned back in her chair, processing. "So what happens now? You join up with this Galloway guy and his SPEAR organization?"

"Eventually," Rusty said. "First, I need to finish what I started today. Make the rounds of every major news network. Testify before the UN. Talk to governments, scientists, military leaders. Plant the idea in as many minds as possible so that when people start disappearing and coming back with powers, the world isn't completely blindsided."

"And when the Living Superweapons start appearing?" Sarah asked. "What then?"

"Then we hope they're on our side," Rusty said. "Because the Grays might have given them powers, but they can't control how humans use those powers. Some will want to fight the Alliance. Others will try to use their abilities for personal gain. And some..." He trailed off, remembering Kor-Thalen's warning. "Some will be so dangerous that the question won't be whether they can fight the Alliance, but whether humanity can survive having them on our side."

The conversation continued late into the night, but eventually even Emily's questions ran dry. Sarah fell asleep with her head on Rusty's shoulder, exhausted by two years of grief finally released. Emily stayed awake longer, her sharp eyes studying her brother like he was a stranger wearing a familiar face.

"You're different," she finally said. "Not just thinner, not just the weird alien clothes. You're... harder. Like something in you broke and healed wrong."

Rusty didn't deny it. "I saw things out there, Em. Things that make me realize how small we are. How fragile. The Grays have technology that would look like magic to us. The Alliance has weapons that make nuclear bombs look like firecrackers. And we're just... we're just barely past the point of hitting rocks together to make fire. We don't belong in this fight."

"But we're in it anyway," Emily said.

"We're in it anyway," Rusty agreed. "So we adapt. We evolve. We become something more. That's what the Living Superweapons are—humans who've been pushed past our limitations, forced to become more than what we were. It's not natural. It's probably not even right. But it's necessary."

"Sounds lonely," Emily observed.

"It is," Rusty admitted. "The Grays told me that most of the Living Superweapons will struggle with what they become. They'll lose themselves in their powers, or they'll be consumed by the responsibility, or they'll just... break under the weight of knowing what's coming. I'm supposed to help them. Supposed to be a voice of experience, someone who's already been changed by the Grays and come back mostly intact." He laughed bitterly. "As if I'm intact."

Emily reached across and took his hand. "You came back. That's what matters. You came back, and you're trying to save the world. That's more than most people would do."

"Or less," Rusty countered. "Most people wouldn't need saving if I'd somehow convinced the Grays to share their technology instead of their warnings. We could have weapons that match the Alliance. We could have ships, defenses—"

"The Grays said no?" Emily guessed.

Rusty nodded. "They said humanity isn't ready for that level of technology. That we'd use it on each other long before the Alliance arrived. They're probably right." He squeezed his sister's hand. "So instead, we get the minimum viable survival package: eight years of warning, one thousand weapons disguised as humans, and a hope that it'll be enough. That's our plan. That's all we've got."

"Then we'd better make it count," Emily said firmly.

The next morning brought chaos. Rusty's press conference had gone viral—actual viral, not the watered-down version the term usually meant. Every news network on every continent was running the story. Social media had exploded with reactions ranging from belief to mockery to outright panic. Three different governments had issued official statements denying any knowledge of alien contact. The UN had called an emergency session.

And somewhere in China, a blind massage therapist named Liu Xiao was about to walk home in the rain and have his entire world change.

But Rusty didn't know that yet. Standing in front of a bathroom mirror, staring at a face made gaunt by alien rationing, he could only see the reflection of a messenger who'd delivered his message and now had to live with the consequences.

Eight years, he thought. Eight years until the Alliance arrives. Eight years to prepare. Eight years until we find out if humanity deserves to survive.

His phone—they'd given him a new one, preprogrammed with contacts he'd need—buzzed with incoming calls. The President. The UN Secretary-General. Vaughn Galloway. Every major news network. Three different book publishers. His agent, who he'd forgotten he even had, asking about movie rights to his "incredible story."

Rusty ignored them all. He had one more call to make first.

His mother answered on the first ring. "Rusty?" Her voice was thick with tears, with joy, with relief so profound it was almost painful to hear.

"Hey, Mom," Rusty said, and for the first time since coming back, his voice broke. "I'm coming home."

*End Chapter One*

## CHAPTER TWO: LIU XIAO
### The Blind Man's Gift

*Year 0 - One year before Rusty's return*

The massage parlor smelled of camphor oil, tiger balm, and the faint sweetness of jasmine incense that never quite masked the underlying odor of elderly bodies and hard work. Liu Xiao didn't mind. After forty-nine years of blindness, his other senses had become so acute that he could navigate the world through scent and sound alone, building maps in his mind more detailed than anything eyes could provide.

He finished with his final client of the day—Mrs. Chen, who came every Tuesday with complaints about her lower back that Liu suspected had more to do with loneliness than lumbar pain—and carefully counted out his modest earnings. The bills felt different now than they had when he was young. The government had updated the currency's texture markers for the blind three times in his life, each iteration supposedly an improvement. Liu wasn't convinced, but he'd learned long ago that complaining about small things was a waste of precious energy.

"Lee is late," observed his colleague, Old Wang, from the massage table beside him. Wang had lost his sight to diabetes fifteen years ago and still spoke about colors as if he could remember them. Liu, who'd been born into darkness, had never understood the appeal.

"The traffic," Liu replied automatically, though unease stirred in his stomach. His son was never late. Lee was many things—distracted, overly focused on his architecture studies, sometimes impatient with his father's slow movements—but punctual to a fault. The boy had inherited that from his mother, rest her soul.

Liu made his way to the narrow staff room at the back of the parlor, his cane tapping a familiar rhythm on the tiles. He'd worked here for twenty-three years, since Lee was six years old. Every chip in the floor, every door frame, every windowsill was catalogued in his mental map. This place was more home than his cramped apartment in the old district.

He pulled on his coat—autumn was creeping into Beijing, bringing its customary chill—and settled onto the wooden bench just inside the parlor's entrance. Through the open door, he could hear the city's symphony: the hiss of bus brakes, the chatter of street vendors, the electronic beeps of pedestrian crossings, the endless conversation of millions of people layered on top of each other in a space too small to hold them all comfortably.

Somewhere in that cacophony, his sister was still alive.

Liu pushed the thought away as soon as it surfaced, but like all unwanted thoughts, it clung to him with barbed edges. Twenty-seven years since the CCP had come for her. Twenty-seven years since Liu had hidden in the crawlspace beneath their childhood home while his sister screamed in the street outside. They'd wanted her for something—he'd never learned what. Some political dissidence their father had been involved in before the cancer took him. Some debt that could only be paid in bodies and confessions.

Liu had been twenty-two then, newly blind but not yet resigned to it. He'd hidden like a coward while they took his sister away, and he'd never seen—never heard—her again.

No. Not seen. He'd never seen anything. Never heard her again. Never felt her hand on his shoulder or smelled her cheap perfume or—

"Mr. Liu?" A young voice, female, unfamiliar. "Are you alright?"

Liu realized his hands were shaking. He forced them still, forced his breathing to even out. "Fine. Just tired. Long day."

The woman—she smelled of expensive university textbooks and some Western perfume—made a sympathetic sound and moved on. Liu listened to her footsteps fade into the city's noise and wondered if she'd ever had to hide while her family was torn apart. Probably not. Young people today didn't remember the old purges, the old fears. For them, the CCP was just the government, not the monster that dragged people into black vans in the middle of the night.

Better that way, Liu supposed. Better to forget.

An hour passed. The parlor's owner, Mr. Zhao, emerged to lock up for the night. "Still waiting for Lee?" he asked gently. Mr. Zhao was a good man, patient with his blind employees, always ensuring they got home safely.

"He'll come," Liu said, but the words felt hollow.

Mr. Zhao hesitated. Liu could hear it in the way his breathing changed, the small shuffle of feet that meant he was about to say something he didn't want to say. "I can call you a car. My treat. It's getting dark."

"I'm blind," Liu said with a dry smile. "Dark and light are the same to me."

"You know what I mean. It's getting late. Lee is a good boy, but young people today... their phones, their social media, they get distracted. He probably forgot—"

"Lee doesn't forget," Liu interrupted. Too sharply. He softened his tone. "Thank you, Mr. Zhao. But I'm sure he'll be here soon."

Another pause. Then Mr. Zhao's footsteps retreating, the jingle of keys, the click of the lock. The sound of rain beginning to fall.

Liu sat alone on the bench, listening to the rain patter against the awning overhead. Beijing rain smelled different than rain in the countryside where he'd grown up—metallic, chemical, but not necessarily unpleasant. Just different. Everything in Beijing was different.

Another hour. The rain intensified, a proper autumn downpour that sent pedestrians scurrying for cover and turned the street into a river of flowing water and honking taxis. Liu's phone—a simple model designed for the blind, with tactile buttons and voice functions—remained silent in his pocket.

Something was wrong.

He knew it with the certainty of a man who'd spent his entire life reading the world through its absences and presences. Lee should have called by now, should have texted, should have sent some word. The fact that he hadn't meant either something terrible had happened or—

Or Lee had simply forgotten his father. Gotten absorbed in his studies, or a girl, or any of the thousand distractions available to young people in the age of smartphones and instant gratification. It had happened before, though not often. Lee was a good son. He tried.

Liu stood, folding his cane to its full extension. The rain was heavy enough that he could hear it bouncing off the pavement, could feel the spray carried by the wind. Walking home in this would be miserable. Walking home blind in this would be dangerous.

But sitting here indefinitely, pathetic and helpless, waiting for rescue that might not come—that was worse.

He stepped out from under the awning and immediately felt the rain plastering his thinning hair to his skull, soaking through his cheap coat. The cold was shocking, but he'd endured worse. He'd endured forty-nine years of darkness. He could endure some water.

The walk home was only a few blocks, but Liu had never attempted it without Lee's guidance. He knew the route intellectually—straight for two blocks, left at the electronics store with the too-loud music, another block and a half, then right into his building's alley—but knowing and navigating were different things.

He started forward, cane tapping, ears straining to separate useful sounds from the rain's white noise. The first intersection was the hardest. He couldn't see the lights, couldn't gauge traffic flow visually. He had to wait for the audible signal—a cheerful electronic tune that felt deeply inappropriate given his mood—and even then, he had to trust that cars would obey traffic laws.

They usually did. Usually.

Halfway across, a horn blared. Liu froze, heart hammering, unsure which direction the sound had come from. Another horn, closer. A voice shouting in Mandarin: "Move, old man!"

Liu moved, stumbling forward, his cane catching on something—a pothole, a curb, he wasn't sure—and he went down hard on his hands and knees. The pavement bit into his palms. Rain immediately soaked through his pants.

More shouting, but farther away now. Liu had made it across, somehow. He pushed himself upright, retrieved his cane, and continued walking. His hands stung. His dignity stung worse.

One block. He could do one block.

The electronics store appeared in his acoustic map as a sudden assault of competing K-pop songs and advertisements for the latest smartphones. Liu navigated around it, using the sound as a landmark, and turned left.

Another intersection. Another wait for the audio signal. This time Liu stood well back from the curb, ignoring the impatient pedestrians who flowed around him like water around a stone.

He was halfway across when he heard the shouting.

Not traffic-related shouting. Not the casual calls of vendors or the playful arguments of friends. This was the kind of shouting that raised every hair on Liu's neck, that sent him spiraling back twenty-seven years to a dark crawlspace and his sister's screams.

The sound came from ahead and to his left—maybe across the street, maybe just down the block. Multiple voices, all male, all angry. Words cut through the rain: demands, curses, the unmistakable prelude to violence.

Liu should have kept walking. Should have minded his own business, reached his apartment, locked the door, and forgotten whatever altercation was unfolding in the Beijing rain. He was blind. He was old. He was no one's idea of a hero.

But his sister had screamed while he hid, and he'd spent twenty-seven years being ashamed of that, and maybe tonight the rain and Lee's absence and his scraped hands had worn his self-preservation too thin.

He turned toward the shouting.

His cane found the far curb. He stepped up, oriented himself toward the sound, and moved forward. The rain was a curtain he could feel but not see through. The shouting grew clearer: three distinct voices, maybe four, speaking Beijing dialect thick with threat.

"We told you to pay up!"

"I don't have it! I told you—"

The meaty sound of fist meeting flesh. A cry of pain.

Liu's cane found a wall. He followed it, using the sound to guide him. The shouting was close now, maybe twenty feet away. An alley, he thought. They were in an alley.

"Please, I need more time—"

Another hit. The sound of a body hitting pavement. Kicking sounds.

Liu's hands found a fence—chain-link, rusted. He felt along it until he found a gap. The opening to the alley. He hesitated there, one hand on wet metal, rain streaming down his face, fifty years of caution warring with a shame that had no expiration date.

Then he heard it: the smaller sound beneath the shouts and blows. Quiet, almost inaudible. Crying.

A child.

Liu stepped into the alley.

"Who's there?" One of the voices, sharp with surprise and suspicion.

Liu said nothing. He took another step forward, his cane extended, his free hand out as if he could feel the air itself for threats.

"It's just some blind old man," another voice said, dismissive. "Get lost, grandpa. This doesn't concern you."

Liu's cane touched fabric. The fallen man. He could hear the man's labored breathing, could smell blood mixing with rain. Beside the man, the small sound of a child trying not to sob aloud.

"I said get lost!" Footsteps approaching. Liu stood his ground.

A hand grabbed his shoulder, rough, spinning him around. "Are you deaf too? Move, or—"

Liu wasn't sure what happened next. Later, he would try to remember the exact sequence of events and find nothing but fragmentary impressions. He remembered his cane being knocked from his hand. He remembered stumbling backward, arms windmilling for balance. He remembered the sensation of falling, of cold rain and hard pavement rushing up to meet him.

And then—

Light.

Not metaphorical light. Not the absence of darkness that he'd imagined all his life when sighted people tried to explain their world. Actual, genuine, impossible light.

It poured into his eyes like molten gold, like the sun condensed to liquid and injected directly into his optic nerves. Liu screamed. He couldn't help it. The sensation was too much, too alien, too overwhelming. His hands clawed at his face, trying to shut out the light, but his eyelids made no difference. The light came from inside, from everywhere, from nowhere.

Then, as quickly as it had come, it faded. Not to darkness—Liu didn't have a word for what replaced the light. Vision, maybe. The world in shapes and colors and impossible detail.

He could see.

He could see the rain falling in individual droplets, each one catching and refracting the orange glow of streetlights. He could see the alley's cracked pavement, the overflowing dumpster, the graffiti on the walls. He could see the three men standing frozen, staring at him with expressions of shock and fear.

And he could see the spheres.

They floated around him like planets in orbit—five of them, each the size of a basketball, perfectly round and gleaming with that same golden light that had burned through his blindness. Tendrils extended from each sphere, metallic and organic at once, writhing in the rain like living things.

One of the men broke first, turning to run. The nearest sphere moved, faster than thought, and a tendril whipped out to brush against the man's neck. The man collapsed mid-stride, unconscious before he hit the ground.

The other two ran in opposite directions. The spheres moved again, faster, and suddenly both men were on the ground, twitching, groaning, alive but incapacitated.

Liu stared at his hands. He could see them. He could see his fingers, wrinkled and age-spotted and trembling. He could see the blood on his palms from where he'd fallen. He could see everything.

"Help..."

The voice came from behind him. Liu turned—turned and saw—and found the man he'd been trying to protect. Mid-thirties, bleeding from his mouth, cradling a little girl who couldn't have been more than seven. Both of them were staring at Liu with the kind of fear usually reserved for monsters.

The spheres continued to orbit, their tendrils brushing against the rain, leaving trails of golden light. Liu realized he could feel them. Not with his hands or his eyes, but with something else, something new. They were connected to him, he understood. They were his, in the way that hands and feet were his.

And they would do whatever he asked.

The thought should have terrified him. Maybe it did, somewhere beneath the overwhelming shock of suddenly possessing vision after forty-nine years of darkness. But mostly what Liu felt was power. Pure, intoxicating power. The ability to protect instead of hide. To act instead of cower.

To never again be the man who hid while his sister was taken.

"You're bleeding," Liu said to the man, and his voice sounded strange to his own ears. Confident. Certain. "Take your daughter home. You're safe now."

The man nodded frantically, scooped up his daughter, and ran. Liu watched them go, watched their shapes diminish in the rain until they disappeared around a corner. He watched with eyes that shouldn't work, guided by spheres that shouldn't exist, standing in an alley in Beijing while everything he'd ever known about himself became obsolete.

He looked down at the three unconscious attackers. The spheres could kill them, he knew. He could feel that potential hovering at the edge of his thoughts, waiting for permission. They had hurt a child. They deserved punishment.

But Liu had spent twenty-seven years being ashamed of hiding, and he refused to spend the next twenty-seven being ashamed of killing. He left them where they lay and walked out of the alley.

The walk home took ten minutes that felt like hours. Every step brought new miracles and new terrors. He could see the city. He could see Beijing in all its grimy, beautiful, overwhelming glory. Buildings reached toward a sky he'd only imagined. Neon signs blazed in colors he didn't have names for. People rushed past, their faces alive with expressions he'd only sensed before.

And everywhere, the spheres followed him, patient and obedient and utterly alien.

His apartment building was exactly where he remembered it, except now he could see the chipped paint, the cracked steps, the rust on the handrails. He climbed to the third floor, his legs remembering the journey even as his eyes insisted he'd never been here before.

His key stuck in the lock—it always did—but now he could see why: the mechanism was slightly bent. Such a small thing. Such a revelation.

Inside, his apartment was smaller than he'd imagined. Darker. He'd kept it meticulously organized, everything in its place so his hands could find what his eyes couldn't. But seeing it now, he realized how little he'd actually had. A narrow bed. A small table with one chair. A radio older than Lee. The walls were stained with water damage he'd never known about.

This was his life. Forty-nine years of careful navigation through a world designed for sight, and all he had to show for it was this cramped box and a job that would have been automated years ago if not for government quotas requiring businesses to employ the disabled.

One of the spheres drifted past his face, close enough that he could see his reflection in its golden surface. An old man stared back at him. Older than he'd imagined himself. Haggard. Frightened.

But also changed. Behind his reflection, in the depths of the sphere, he could see... something. Movement. Intention. Vast and patient and utterly incomprehensible.

Liu sat on his bed, careful not to disturb the spheres, and pulled out his phone. His hands still remembered the tactile buttons even though he could now see the screen. He called Lee.

The phone rang four times before going to voicemail. Lee's cheerful voice, recorded months ago: "Hey, you've reached Lee. Leave a message!"

"Lee," Liu said quietly. "I... something happened tonight. I'm home now. I'm safe. But Lee, I can see. I don't know how, I don't know why, but I can see. Call me when you get this. Please."

He hung up and sat in silence, watching the spheres orbit him like devoted servants or curious observers or something he didn't have language for. Outside, the rain continued to fall. Beijing continued to rush and honk and live its massive, indifferent life.

And somewhere in the city, Liu knew with suddenly certain clarity, there were more people like him. More people who'd been changed, enhanced, weaponized by forces they didn't understand. The man on the yacht, the one all the foreigners were talking about—Rusty Richards. He'd warned about this. About people vanishing and returning with powers.

Liu hadn't vanished. He'd only fallen in the rain.

But the result was the same: he was different now. Changed. The Grays—that's what Richards had called them—the Grays had given him a gift. Or a curse. Or a responsibility.

The spheres pulsed gently, as if responding to his thoughts.

"What am I supposed to do with you?" Liu whispered to them. "What am I supposed to be?"

The spheres offered no answer, but Liu didn't really expect one. He was forty-nine years old. He'd been blind since birth. He'd hidden while his sister was taken. He'd scraped by for decades, grateful for whatever scraps of independence and dignity he could maintain.

But now...

Now he could see. Now he had power. Now the government that had taken his sister would want to take him too, would want to study his powers, use them, own them. He'd have to report this. Chinese citizens were required by law to report any contact with alien life forms or acquisition of paranormal abilities.

The law had been passed three months ago, after Richards' press conference had sent shockwaves through every government on Earth. Failure to report was considered treason.

Liu looked at his small apartment, at his small life, at the reflection of a man who'd spent forty-nine years being invisible. The CCP would come for him. Tomorrow, probably, when his neighbors reported the golden light. Or when someone found the three unconscious men in the alley and checked security cameras.

They would come, and Liu would have a choice.

He could hide again, like he'd hidden for his sister. Could try to suppress the spheres, control them, keep them secret.

Or he could accept what he'd become and face whatever consequences came with it.

Liu lay down on his bed, fully clothed, water still dripping from his coat onto the thin mattress. The spheres settled around him like strange guardians, their golden light casting shadows that danced across the water-stained walls.

He closed his eyes—newly functional eyes that could close and open and see—and tried to sleep.

Tomorrow, he knew, everything would change. Tonight, for just a few more hours, he could be Liu Xiao: blind massage therapist, good father, survivor of small tragedies.

Tomorrow he would become something else.

Something the world needed, even if they didn't know it yet.

The spheres hummed softly in the darkness, and for the first time in twenty-seven years, Liu slept without dreaming of his sister's screams.
