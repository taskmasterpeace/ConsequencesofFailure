## CHAPTER ONE: THE RETURN
### Rusty Richards

The chaotic vortex deposited Rusty Richards exactly where it had taken him—standing upright, eyes wide, hands still trembling from the phone call he'd been having two years ago.

For a disorienting heartbeat, he thought he was still on the yacht. The sensation of motion, the smell of salt air, the distant sound of music—all of it felt so real that he nearly turned to go back inside to the party.

Then his feet touched grass instead of deck planking.

His eyes focused.

He wasn't in the Caribbean anymore.

Rusty stood in the middle of a football field in Derby, Australia. The afternoon sun beat down on him with a different angle, a different intensity than the Caribbean night he'd left behind. The grass beneath his feet was yellowed from drought. In the distance, he could see residential homes, a water tower, power lines cutting across a sky that was too blue, too vast, too *wrong* after two years of the Grays' dimensional space.

His phone was gone. So was his champagne glass. So was everything except the clothes on his back—and even those had changed. The designer suit he'd worn to celebrate the Glamorous Lyrist award had been replaced by something that looked like fabric but felt like it was breathing against his skin. Gray material that shifted colors in the sunlight, beautiful and utterly alien.

"Oh God," Rusty whispered. His first words in two years. They tasted strange in his mouth, like he'd forgotten how human speech worked.

A dog started barking. Rusty turned and saw a golden retriever pressed against a chain-link fence bordering the field, losing its mind at the sight of him. Behind the dog, a woman stood frozen in her backyard, garden hose forgotten in her hand, water pooling around her feet as she stared at the man who'd just appeared out of nowhere in the middle of the sporting field.

She dropped the hose.

She ran.

Rusty wanted to call after her, to explain, but what would he say? *Don't worry, I'm just a musician who's been living with dimensional aliens for two years and now I'm back to warn Earth about an invasion force that will arrive in eight years?*

Yeah. That would go over well.

More people were emerging from their homes now, drawn by the barking dog and the woman's screams. Rusty could see them pointing, hear them shouting questions at each other. Someone was already filming him on their phone—of course they were. This was the modern world. Everything got filmed.

Good, Rusty thought, remembering what Kor-Thalen had told him. *Let them film. Let them share. The message must spread quickly, before governments can suppress it.*

His legs gave out.

The ground came up fast, and Rusty's palms hit the sun-baked grass hard enough to sting. Two years of low gravity aboard the Gray vessel had weakened him more than he'd realized. Or maybe it was the shock of being home. Of being *real* again, in a world that operated by physics he understood, where time moved in one direction and space had three dimensions instead of seven.

Sirens in the distance. Getting closer.

Rusty tried to stand, but his body wasn't cooperating. Everything felt too heavy. Earth's gravity pressed down on him like a blanket made of lead. How had he ever walked around carrying this much weight?

A police cruiser screamed into the field, tires tearing up the grass. Two officers emerged, hands on their weapons, approaching him cautiously like he might be dangerous.

"Don't move!" the first officer shouted—a woman with dark skin and sharp eyes. "Keep your hands where I can see them!"

Rusty raised his hands slowly. "I'm not armed," he said. His voice sounded wrong to his own ears. Too thin. Too human. "I'm... I'm Rusty Richards. I've been missing for two years. I need to make a statement. A public statement. International broadcast."

The second officer—older, with a gray mustache—squinted at him. "Did you say Rusty Richards? The musician?"

"Yes."

"Bloody hell, Diane, it is him. Look at his face." The older officer pulled out his radio. "Central, we need to confirm identity on a possible missing person. White male, approximately thirty years old, claims to be Rusty Richards—yeah, *that* Rusty Richards. American musician who vanished off his yacht two years back."

More vehicles were arriving. The crowd was growing. Rusty could see phones everywhere, dozens of cameras pointed at him, livestreaming his return to millions of people who had no idea what they were about to hear.

Perfect.

"Mr. Richards," Officer Diane said, still wary but holstering her weapon. "Where have you been? How did you get here?"

Rusty met her eyes. "I was taken by an alien species called the Grays. They've been observing humanity since before recorded history. They took me to their base—I can't tell you where it is because the Grays exist partially outside our normal space-time—but I can tell you that in eight years, an armada of four hostile alien civilizations will arrive at Earth with the intention of terraforming our atmosphere and exterminating every human being on the planet."

The football field went silent.

Even the dog stopped barking.

Officer Diane's hand moved back toward her weapon. "Sir, have you consumed any drugs or alcohol?"

"I'm completely sober," Rusty said. "And I know how this sounds. The Grays predicted exactly this reaction. But in the coming weeks, people around the world will begin to vanish and return with extraordinary abilities. The Grays are creating Living Superweapons—humans enhanced with powers and knowledge to fight the invasion. I was sent back to warn everyone. To prepare you. To give humanity a chance."

An ambulance arrived, followed by more police vehicles, followed by news vans—three of them, cameras already deploying. Word was spreading fast. Rusty Richards, the famous musician who'd vanished mysteriously two years ago, had just appeared out of thin air in Derby, Australia, babbling about alien invasions.

This was going to be international news in minutes.

Officer Diane was speaking into her radio, but Rusty wasn't listening. He was watching the news crews set up, watching the journalists approach with microphones and hungry expressions. This was it. This was the moment Kor-Thalen had prepared him for.

"I need to speak to them," Rusty said, pointing at the journalists. "Please. Everything I'm saying is true. You'll see. In weeks, maybe days, people will start disappearing and coming back changed. When that happens, you'll remember this moment. You'll remember that I tried to warn you."

The older officer with the mustache was staring at Rusty's clothing. "What the hell are you wearing, mate? That's not... that's not any fabric I've ever seen."

"It's Gray technology," Rusty said. "It regulates body temperature, repairs itself, and adapts to environmental conditions. The Grays gave it to me because human clothing wouldn't survive dimensional transit." He looked down at the shimmering material. "It's also the only physical evidence I have, and I'm betting your government will confiscate it within the hour."

A black SUV pulled up, and Rusty's stomach sank. He recognized the type: government vehicle, probably American despite being in Australia. The Grays had warned him about this too.

A man in an expensive suit emerged—mid-fifties, silver hair, American flag pin on his lapel. "Rusty Richards," the man said, his voice carrying the smooth authority of someone used to being obeyed. "I'm Deputy Director James Hartley, U.S. Department of Defense. We're very glad to see you alive, Mr. Richards. Your family will be overjoyed."

Family. The word punched through Rusty's chest like a bullet. Sarah. Emily. Mom. Dad. Two years. They'd mourned him. Buried an empty casket. Moved on with their lives while he was light-years away learning about the end of the world.

"Before you see them," Rusty said, his voice harder than he'd intended, "I'm making a statement. Public. International. Right now." He pointed at the news crews. "They're already filming. This is going to be broadcast whether you cooperate or not. You can either help me do it properly, or you can spend the next eight years explaining why the U.S. government tried to suppress information about an alien invasion."

Hartley's professional smile didn't waver, but something cold flickered in his eyes. "Mr. Richards, you've clearly been through a traumatic experience. We need to debrief you, get you medical attention—"

"I don't need medical attention. I need a microphone." Rusty started walking toward the news vans on legs that threatened to buckle. Officer Diane moved to stop him, but Hartley raised a hand.

"Let him go," the Deputy Director said quietly. "Better to let him speak now and control the narrative later than to create a incident."

The journalists surged toward Rusty like sharks scenting blood in the water. Microphones thrust into his face. Questions bombarded him from every direction. But Rusty raised his hands, and the crowd quieted. It was an old musician's trick—silence draws more attention than shouting.

"My name is Rusty Richards," he began, and his voice didn't shake. "Two years ago, I disappeared from my yacht during a celebration. Most of you assumed I'd fallen overboard drunk. Some thought I'd been kidnapped. A few conspiracy theorists suggested aliens."

He paused, letting the moment breathe.

"The conspiracy theorists were right."

Nervous laughter rippled through the crowd. Rusty didn't smile.

"I was taken by an alien species called the Grays. Not abducted—recruited. They've been watching humanity for thousands of years, waiting for us to reach a specific level of technological development. They took me because I have a platform. Because when I speak, millions listen. Because they needed someone who could deliver a message that most people won't want to believe."

The laughter had died. Every eye was on him. Every camera was rolling.

"In eight years," Rusty continued, "an armada will arrive at Earth. Four alien civilizations have formed an alliance—the Alliance of Four. They believe Earth is polluting local space with our electromagnetic emissions, our satellite debris, our nuclear tests. They've deemed us a contamination. Their mission is to terraform our atmosphere into something breathable for them and instantly lethal for us. Every human being will die. Every animal. Every plant. Earth will become an alien world, and our entire species will be erased from existence."

A woman dropped her camera. The sound of it hitting the ground was like a gunshot in the sudden silence.

"The Grays oppose this extermination," Rusty said. "They believe humanity deserves a chance to defend ourselves. So they've created a plan. Starting soon—it may have already started—people around the world will begin to vanish. They'll be taken to the Grays' dimensional space for days, weeks, sometimes months. When they return, they'll be transformed. Enhanced. The Grays call them Living Superweapons. Men and women with powers that defy physics. Instant expertise in fields they've never studied. Symbiotic relationships with alien organisms that grant extraordinary capabilities."

A journalist found his voice. "You're saying aliens are going to start kidnapping people and turning them into superheroes?"

"I'm saying aliens are recruiting soldiers for a war most of you don't believe can happen," Rusty corrected. "The Grays estimate they can enhance approximately one thousand humans before the Alliance arrives. One thousand weapons against an armada that's already exterminated six other species. Those aren't good odds. But they're the only odds we have."

"Why should we believe you?" Another journalist, skeptical. "You could have been anywhere for two years. In rehab. In hiding. This could be a publicity stunt for a new album."

Rusty turned to face the skeptic directly. "Believe me or don't. Most people will choose not to. The Grays predicted that. But in the coming weeks, the first Living Superweapons will start appearing. People will vanish and return with impossible abilities. Countries will scramble to militarize these individuals. Conflicts will erupt over how to control them. And eventually, someone will detect the Alliance armada entering our solar system. When that happens, you'll realize I was telling the truth. I just hope that realization doesn't come too late."

"If they're eight years away," a woman in the crowd called out, "they'd have to be traveling faster than light. How is that even possible? And if they are, why haven't we detected them already?"

Finally, Rusty thought. Someone asking the right technical questions.

"They are traveling faster than light," Rusty confirmed. "The Grays explained that faster-than-light objects are incredibly difficult to detect because they appear exponentially dimmer the faster they move. It's called relativistic dimming—the photons get compressed in ways that make the object nearly invisible to conventional telescopes. We actually have the technology to detect FTL objects right now, but we don't look for them because conventional physics says they can't exist. The Alliance exploits this assumption. As long as they don't decelerate near Earth too early, our telescopes will never see them coming."

Murmurs rippled through the crowd. A physicist-looking man shouted, "Is that even real science?"

"It's theoretical physics," Rusty replied. "Look up tachyon theory, relativistic dimming effects. The math exists—we just never built detection systems to look for it because we assumed faster-than-light travel was impossible. The Grays said that's humanity's biggest weakness: we don't look for things we don't believe in. We're about to pay for that blind spot."

"Mr. Richards!" A man in a suit pushed through the crowd—younger than Hartley, with a United Nations pin on his lapel. "If what you're saying is accurate, what should the international community do? What concrete actions should we take?"

Finally. The right question.

"Unite," Rusty said simply. "In eight years, national borders won't matter. The Alliance doesn't distinguish between Americans, Chinese, Nigerians, Indians, Australians. They're coming for all of us. We need a unified global response. An international organization dedicated to researching these Living Superweapons, training them, preparing them for what's coming. The Grays shared intelligence about the Alliance—their weapons, their tactics, their weaknesses. Yes, they have weaknesses. But that intelligence is worthless if we spend the next eight years fighting each other instead of preparing for them."

"And who would lead such an organization?" the UN official pressed.

Rusty shrugged. "I'm a musician. I write songs about heartbreak and hope. I'm nobody's idea of a military commander. But I know people who are qualified. People who've been preparing for something like this their whole lives." He looked directly at the nearest camera, knowing that somewhere, Vaughn Galloway was watching. "People who are probably already planning something."

The questions continued for another hour. Rusty answered as many as he could, repeating the same information in different ways, planting seeds in a thousand different minds. When his voice started to give out, the paramedics finally convinced him to get in the ambulance.

"You're dehydrated," a young medic said, inserting an IV line with practiced efficiency. "Malnourished too, by the look of you. When's the last time you ate?"

"About six hours ago, by my count," Rusty said. "But time works differently where I was. It might have been six days. Hard to tell."

The medic exchanged a worried glance with his partner. Great. They thought he was crazy. Everyone would think he was crazy until the first Living Superweapon appeared and proved him right.

Deputy Director Hartley climbed into the ambulance, his professional smile firmly back in place. "That was quite a performance, Mr. Richards."

"It wasn't a performance. It was a warning."

"Regardless. The President wants to speak with you. So does the UN Secretary-General. So do approximately forty heads of state, every major news network on the planet, and—" Hartley checked his phone, "—about three thousand journalists who are currently camped outside this field. You've created quite a situation."

"Good. Situations demand action." Rusty leaned back against the ambulance bench, suddenly exhausted. "When can I see my family?"

"They're being flown to Darwin now. Your girlfriend Sarah and your sister Emily. They should arrive within two hours." Hartley's expression softened slightly. "Sarah wants you to know she never stopped believing you were alive. Emily... well, your sister has some choice words for you about the heart attack you gave your mother."

Despite everything, Rusty smiled. "That sounds like Emily."

"Before you see them, I need to ask—did the Grays give you anything? Technology? Evidence? Anything to substantiate your claims?"

Rusty shook his head. "They said physical evidence would be confiscated or dismissed as fabrication. Better to let the evidence appear on its own when people start returning with powers. That's proof that can't be denied."

"Convenient," Hartley muttered.

"Strategic," Rusty corrected. "The Grays have been planning this intervention for centuries. They understand how humans think, how governments operate. They knew I'd be detained, debriefed, questioned. They knew you'd want evidence I couldn't provide. They accounted for all of it. That's why they chose this method—public revelation, immediate broadcast, impossible to completely suppress."

Hartley's phone buzzed. He glanced at it, frowned, then turned the screen toward Rusty. "You've got an incoming video call request. Vaughn Galloway. The billionaire UFO guy. You know him?"

Rusty's heart rate kicked up. Kor-Thalen had told him this would happen. "I know of him. He's been preparing for something like this his whole life."

"Want me to patch him through?" Hartley asked, skepticism clear in his voice.

"Yes."

The medic handed Rusty a tablet, and moments later, Vaughn Galloway's face filled the screen. Silver-streaked hair, sharp eyes, expensive office visible behind him—Geneva, maybe, or New York. The man looked like he hadn't slept, but his energy was electric.

"Mr. Richards," Galloway said without preamble. "I watched your press conference. Every word. I've spent thirty years studying UFO phenomena, analyzing abduction reports, tracking patterns in satellite data that conventional scientists dismiss as noise. I didn't know the specifics—I didn't know about the Grays or the Alliance of Four—but I knew something was coming."

"You believe me," Rusty said. It wasn't a question.

"I've already begun preliminary work on a private organization to address extraterrestrial threats. I was calling it FIST—First Infantry Strike Team. But after hearing your suggestion about international cooperation, I think SPEAR has a better ring to it. Special Personnel for Extraterrestrial Assault and Research." Galloway leaned closer to the camera. "I need everything the Grays told you. Every detail about the Alliance, about the enhancement process, about the invasion timeline. And I need to know—is this worth me flying to Australia, or should we start coordinating remotely right now?"

Rusty glanced at Hartley, who was listening intently despite himself. "The Grays showed me your face," Rusty said quietly. "They told me you'd be part of this. They said you were one of the few people on Earth already preparing, already building something that could help. But they also warned me—" He paused, choosing his words carefully. "Not everyone who fights the Alliance fights for humanity's good. Some fight for power. For control. For glory."

Galloway's expression didn't change. "Then let me be clear about my terms. SPEAR won't be an American organization. It won't be a corporate tool. If we're going to survive this, it has to be genuinely international—answerable to the world, not to one government or one boardroom. I have resources, connections, and eight years of preliminary research. What I need from you is everything the Grays taught you. Do we have a deal?"

Rusty studied the man on the screen. Kor-Thalen had shown him this moment, had told him Vaughn Galloway was essential to the plan. Looking into those sharp eyes, Rusty saw ambition, brilliance, and hunger—but also determination. And they didn't have eight years to be picky about allies.

"We have a deal," Rusty said. "On one condition: SPEAR answers to humanity, not to profit. Not to politics. If you can promise me that, I'll tell you everything."

"Agreed," Galloway said without hesitation. "Though making that happen will be its own kind of war."

"Better than the alternative." Rusty leaned back against the ambulance bench, suddenly aware of how exhausted he was. "Stay on the line. I'll walk you through what the Grays showed me. But Galloway—this is going to sound insane, even after everything you just heard."

"Mr. Richards," Galloway said with something that might have been a smile, "I've been called insane for thirty years. Hit me with your best shot."

Hartley stood, phone still pressed to his ear. "I need to brief my superiors. You'll be transported to a secure facility in Darwin for debriefing. Your family's being notified now—they'll fly out tomorrow." He paused at the door, looking back at Rusty with an expression that might have been respect. "Mr. Richards... I don't know if your story is true. But I hope to God it isn't. Because if you're right, we're in more danger than most people can comprehend."

"We are," Rusty confirmed, exhaustion finally catching up to him. "But we have eight years. Eight years to prepare, to train, to become something more than what we are."

After Hartley left, Rusty turned his attention back to the tablet, to Vaughn Galloway's sharp eyes studying him through the screen.

"You still there, Galloway?"

"Not going anywhere," the billionaire replied. "Now—tell me about the Alliance. Start with their capabilities and work backward to their weaknesses. The Grays gave you intelligence, right? Tactical information?"

Rusty nodded slowly. Through the ambulance window, he could see the sun setting over Derby, painting the Australian sky in shades of orange and purple that painfully reminded him of the vortex. Two years. He'd been gone for two years, and now he was back with eight years to prepare for the end of the world.

"The Alliance is made up of four species," Rusty began, his voice hoarse from the day's revelations. "The Iron Eaters, the Slaught, the Deep, and a fourth race the Grays wouldn't name. Each one has already destroyed multiple civilizations. Together, they're nearly unstoppable."

"Nearly," Galloway repeated, leaning forward. "But not completely. What are their weaknesses?"

"That's the thing," Rusty said, meeting Galloway's eyes through the screen. "They're not invincible. The Grays wouldn't have bothered creating Living Superweapons if the Alliance couldn't be fought. But the weaknesses... they're specific. Exploitable only if we prepare the right way, with the right people, using the right knowledge."

"Then we have work to do," Galloway said. "I'm flying to Australia tonight. We'll start building SPEAR's foundation immediately. Every day we waste is a day closer to extinction."

Rusty leaned back against the ambulance bench, the weight of everything settling onto his shoulders like a physical thing. In eight years, the Alliance of Four would arrive. In eight years, humanity would either stand united against extinction—or they'd destroy themselves fighting over the very weapons meant to save them.

Kor-Thalen had shown him both futures. The question was which path humanity would choose.

"Galloway," Rusty said quietly, "when you get here, bring everything you've got on organizational structures, international law, and crisis management. Because the biggest threat isn't the aliens. It's going to be us."

"I know," Galloway replied, his expression grim. "I've been studying human conflict for thirty years. We're about to find out if we can overcome our nature long enough to survive."

The tablet screen went dark as Galloway ended the call. Rusty sat alone in the ambulance, listening to the medics outside discussing his condition in low voices, feeling the IV drip slowly rehydrating his depleted body.

Tomorrow, Sarah and Emily would arrive. Tomorrow, the debriefing would begin in earnest. Tomorrow, the world would start reacting to his warning—some with belief, most with skepticism, all with fear.

But tonight, Rusty Richards was just a man who'd returned from the impossible, carrying knowledge that weighed more than any human should have to bear.

He closed his eyes and saw Kor-Thalen's face—those enormous black eyes that saw through time itself.

"You are the messenger," the Gray had said. "You will tell them. Most will not believe. That is expected. That is factored. But some will. And some is enough."

Rusty hoped the Gray was right.

He hoped some was enough.

Because in eight years, they'd find out if humanity could become more than what they were.

Or if they'd die as what they'd always been.

## AUTHOR'S NOTE

**Chapter 1 Structure:**
- **Time Covered:** Single day (Rusty's return and press conference)
- **Location:** Derby, Australia (football field)
- **Key Events:** Materialization, public warning, Vaughn video call

**Major Changes from Earlier Drafts:**

1. **No Spacecraft** - Follows Episode 0 canon where Rusty appears mysteriously in a field (no pod, no capsule)
2. **FTL Detection Science Added** - Michael Crichton-style real physics education (tachyons, relativistic dimming)
3. **Vaughn via Video Call** - More realistic pacing; they don't meet in person yet
4. **Family Reunion Moved to Chapter 2** - Sarah and Emily arrive tomorrow, not same day
5. **Single Location, Single Day** - Entire chapter happens in Derby within ~8 hours

**What This Accomplishes:**
- Maintains mystery (how did Grays teleport him?)
- Avoids spacecraft logistics problems
- Teaches real science while advancing plot
- Better pacing (not cramming too much into one chapter)
- Sets up SPEAR foundation without rushing
- Ends on contemplative note (Rusty alone, first day back)

**Next Chapter Preview:**
Chapter 2 will cover Rusty's debriefing, Sarah/Emily reunion, and the world's initial reactions to his warning.
