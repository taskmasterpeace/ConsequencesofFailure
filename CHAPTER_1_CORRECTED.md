## CHAPTER ONE: THE RETURN
### Rusty Richards

The chaotic vortex deposited Rusty Richards exactly where it had taken him—standing upright, eyes wide, hands still trembling from the phone call he'd been having two years ago.

For a disorienting heartbeat, he thought he was still on the yacht. The sensation of motion, the smell of salt air, the distant sound of music—all of it felt so real that he nearly turned to go back inside to the party.

Then his feet touched grass instead of deck planking.

His eyes focused.

He wasn't in the Caribbean anymore.

Rusty stood in the middle of a football field in Derby, Australia. The afternoon sun beat down on him with a different angle, a different intensity than the Caribbean night he'd left behind. The grass beneath his feet was yellowed from drought. In the distance, he could see residential homes, a water tower, power lines cutting across a sky that was too blue, too vast, too *wrong* after two years of the Grays' dimensional space.

His phone was gone. So was his champagne glass. So was everything except the clothes on his back—and even those had changed. The designer suit he'd worn to celebrate the Glamorous Lyrist award had been replaced by something that looked like fabric but felt like it was breathing against his skin. Gray material that shifted colors in the sunlight, beautiful and utterly alien.

"Oh God," Rusty whispered. His first words in two years. They tasted strange in his mouth, like he'd forgotten how human speech worked.

A dog started barking. Rusty turned and saw a golden retriever pressed against a chain-link fence bordering the field, losing its mind at the sight of him. Behind the dog, a woman stood frozen in her backyard, garden hose forgotten in her hand, water pooling around her feet as she stared at the man who'd just appeared out of nowhere in the middle of the sporting field.

She dropped the hose.

She ran.

Rusty wanted to call after her, to explain, but what would he say? *Don't worry, I'm just a musician who's been living with dimensional aliens for two years and now I'm back to warn Earth about an invasion force that will arrive in eight years?*

Yeah. That would go over well.

More people were emerging from their homes now, drawn by the barking dog and the woman's screams. Rusty could see them pointing, hear them shouting questions at each other. Someone was already filming him on their phone—of course they were. This was the modern world. Everything got filmed.

Good, Rusty thought, remembering what Kor-Thalen had told him. *Let them film. Let them share. The message must spread quickly, before governments can suppress it.*

His legs gave out.

The ground came up fast, and Rusty's palms hit the sun-baked grass hard enough to sting. Two years of low gravity aboard the Gray vessel had weakened him more than he'd realized. Or maybe it was the shock of being home. Of being *real* again, in a world that operated by physics he understood, where time moved in one direction and space had three dimensions instead of seven.

Sirens in the distance. Getting closer.

Rusty tried to stand, but his body wasn't cooperating. Everything felt too heavy. Earth's gravity pressed down on him like a blanket made of lead. How had he ever walked around carrying this much weight?

A police cruiser screamed into the field, tires tearing up the grass. Two officers emerged, hands on their weapons, approaching him cautiously like he might be dangerous.

"Don't move!" the first officer shouted—a woman with dark skin and sharp eyes. "Keep your hands where I can see them!"

Rusty raised his hands slowly. "I'm not armed," he said. His voice sounded wrong to his own ears. Too thin. Too human. "I'm... I'm Rusty Richards. I've been missing for two years. I need to make a statement. A public statement. International broadcast."

The second officer—older, with a gray mustache—squinted at him. "Did you say Rusty Richards? The musician?"

"Yes."

"Bloody hell, Diane, it is him. Look at his face." The older officer pulled out his radio. "Central, we need to confirm identity on a possible missing person. White male, approximately thirty years old, claims to be Rusty Richards—yeah, *that* Rusty Richards. American musician who vanished off his yacht two years back."

More vehicles were arriving. The crowd was growing. Rusty could see phones everywhere, dozens of cameras pointed at him, livestreaming his return to millions of people who had no idea what they were about to hear.

Perfect.

"Mr. Richards," Officer Diane said, still wary but holstering her weapon. "Where have you been? How did you get here?"

Rusty met her eyes. "I was taken by an alien species called the Grays. They've been observing humanity since before recorded history. They took me to their base—I can't tell you where it is because the Grays exist partially outside our normal space-time—but I can tell you that in eight years, an armada of four hostile alien civilizations will arrive at Earth with the intention of terraforming our atmosphere and exterminating every human being on the planet."

The football field went silent.

Even the dog stopped barking.

Officer Diane's hand moved back toward her weapon. "Sir, have you consumed any drugs or alcohol?"

"I'm completely sober," Rusty said. "And I know how this sounds. The Grays predicted exactly this reaction. But in the coming weeks, people around the world will begin to vanish and return with extraordinary abilities. The Grays are creating Living Superweapons—humans enhanced with powers and knowledge to fight the invasion. I was sent back to warn everyone. To prepare you. To give humanity a chance."

An ambulance arrived, followed by more police vehicles, followed by news vans—three of them, cameras already deploying. Word was spreading fast. Rusty Richards, the famous musician who'd vanished mysteriously two years ago, had just appeared out of thin air in Derby, Australia, babbling about alien invasions.

This was going to be international news in minutes.

Officer Diane was speaking into her radio, but Rusty wasn't listening. He was watching the news crews set up, watching the journalists approach with microphones and hungry expressions. This was it. This was the moment Kor-Thalen had prepared him for.

"I need to speak to them," Rusty said, pointing at the journalists. "Please. Everything I'm saying is true. You'll see. In weeks, maybe days, people will start disappearing and coming back changed. When that happens, you'll remember this moment. You'll remember that I tried to warn you."

The older officer with the mustache was staring at Rusty's clothing. "What the hell are you wearing, mate? That's not... that's not any fabric I've ever seen."

"It's Gray technology," Rusty said. "It regulates body temperature, repairs itself, and adapts to environmental conditions. The Grays gave it to me because human clothing wouldn't survive dimensional transit." He looked down at the shimmering material. "It's also the only physical evidence I have, and I'm betting your government will confiscate it within the hour."

A black SUV pulled up, and Rusty's stomach sank. He recognized the type: government vehicle, probably American despite being in Australia. The Grays had warned him about this too.

A man in an expensive suit emerged—mid-fifties, silver hair, American flag pin on his lapel. "Rusty Richards," the man said, his voice carrying the smooth authority of someone used to being obeyed. "I'm Deputy Director James Hartley, U.S. Department of Defense. We're very glad to see you alive, Mr. Richards. Your family will be overjoyed."

Family. The word punched through Rusty's chest like a bullet. Sarah. Emily. Mom. Dad. Two years. They'd mourned him. Buried an empty casket. Moved on with their lives while he was light-years away learning about the end of the world.

"Before you see them," Rusty said, his voice harder than he'd intended, "I'm making a statement. Public. International. Right now." He pointed at the news crews. "They're already filming. This is going to be broadcast whether you cooperate or not. You can either help me do it properly, or you can spend the next eight years explaining why the U.S. government tried to suppress information about an alien invasion."

Hartley's professional smile didn't waver, but something cold flickered in his eyes. "Mr. Richards, you've clearly been through a traumatic experience. We need to debrief you, get you medical attention—"

"I don't need medical attention. I need a microphone." Rusty started walking toward the news vans on legs that threatened to buckle. Officer Diane moved to stop him, but Hartley raised a hand.

"Let him go," the Deputy Director said quietly. "Better to let him speak now and control the narrative later than to create a incident."

The journalists surged toward Rusty like sharks scenting blood in the water. Microphones thrust into his face. Questions bombarded him from every direction. But Rusty raised his hands, and the crowd quieted. It was an old musician's trick—silence draws more attention than shouting.

"My name is Rusty Richards," he began, and his voice didn't shake. "Two years ago, I disappeared from my yacht during a celebration. Most of you assumed I'd fallen overboard drunk. Some thought I'd been kidnapped. A few conspiracy theorists suggested aliens."

He paused, letting the moment breathe.

"The conspiracy theorists were right."

Nervous laughter rippled through the crowd. Rusty didn't smile.

"I was taken by an alien species called the Grays. Not abducted—recruited. They've been watching humanity for thousands of years, waiting for us to reach a specific level of technological development. They took me because I have a platform. Because when I speak, millions listen. Because they needed someone who could deliver a message that most people won't want to believe."

The laughter had died. Every eye was on him. Every camera was rolling.

"In eight years," Rusty continued, "an armada will arrive at Earth. Four alien civilizations have formed an alliance—the Alliance of Four. They believe Earth is polluting local space with our electromagnetic emissions, our satellite debris, our nuclear tests. They've deemed us a contamination. Their mission is to terraform our atmosphere into something breathable for them and instantly lethal for us. Every human being will die. Every animal. Every plant. Earth will become an alien world, and our entire species will be erased from existence."

A woman dropped her camera. The sound of it hitting the ground was like a gunshot in the sudden silence.

"The Grays oppose this extermination," Rusty said. "They believe humanity deserves a chance to defend ourselves. So they've created a plan. Starting soon—it may have already started—people around the world will begin to vanish. They'll be taken to the Grays' dimensional space for days, weeks, sometimes months. When they return, they'll be transformed. Enhanced. The Grays call them Living Superweapons. Men and women with powers that defy physics. Instant expertise in fields they've never studied. Symbiotic relationships with alien organisms that grant extraordinary capabilities."

A journalist found his voice. "You're saying aliens are going to start kidnapping people and turning them into superheroes?"

"I'm saying aliens are recruiting soldiers for a war most of you don't believe can happen," Rusty corrected. "The Grays estimate they can enhance approximately one thousand humans before the Alliance arrives. One thousand weapons against an armada that's already exterminated six other species. Those aren't good odds. But they're the only odds we have."

"Why should we believe you?" Another journalist, skeptical. "You could have been anywhere for two years. In rehab. In hiding. This could be a publicity stunt for a new album."

Rusty turned to face the skeptic directly. "Believe me or don't. Most people will choose not to. The Grays predicted that. But in the coming weeks, the first Living Superweapons will start appearing. People will vanish and return with impossible abilities. Countries will scramble to militarize these individuals. Conflicts will erupt over how to control them. And eventually, someone will detect the Alliance armada entering our solar system. When that happens, you'll realize I was telling the truth. I just hope that realization doesn't come too late."

"Mr. Richards!" A man in a suit pushed through the crowd—younger than Hartley, with a United Nations pin on his lapel. "If what you're saying is accurate, what should the international community do? What concrete actions should we take?"

Finally. The right question.

"Unite," Rusty said simply. "In eight years, national borders won't matter. The Alliance doesn't distinguish between Americans, Chinese, Nigerians, Indians, Australians. They're coming for all of us. We need a unified global response. An international organization dedicated to researching these Living Superweapons, training them, preparing them for what's coming. The Grays shared intelligence about the Alliance—their weapons, their tactics, their weaknesses. Yes, they have weaknesses. But that intelligence is worthless if we spend the next eight years fighting each other instead of preparing for them."

"And who would lead such an organization?" the UN official pressed.

Rusty shrugged. "I'm a musician. I write songs about heartbreak and hope. I'm nobody's idea of a military commander. But I know people who are qualified. People who've been preparing for something like this their whole lives." He looked directly at the nearest camera, knowing that somewhere, Vaughn Galloway was watching. "People who are probably already planning something."

The questions continued for another hour. Rusty answered as many as he could, repeating the same information in different ways, planting seeds in a thousand different minds. When his voice started to give out, the paramedics finally convinced him to get in the ambulance.

"You're dehydrated," a young medic said, inserting an IV line with practiced efficiency. "Malnourished too, by the look of you. When's the last time you ate?"

"About six hours ago, by my count," Rusty said. "But time works differently where I was. It might have been six days. Hard to tell."

The medic exchanged a worried glance with his partner. Great. They thought he was crazy. Everyone would think he was crazy until the first Living Superweapon appeared and proved him right.

Deputy Director Hartley climbed into the ambulance, his professional smile firmly back in place. "That was quite a performance, Mr. Richards."

"It wasn't a performance. It was a warning."

"Regardless. The President wants to speak with you. So does the UN Secretary-General. So do approximately forty heads of state, every major news network on the planet, and—" Hartley checked his phone, "—about three thousand journalists who are currently camped outside this field. You've created quite a situation."

"Good. Situations demand action." Rusty leaned back against the ambulance bench, suddenly exhausted. "When can I see my family?"

"They're being flown to Darwin now. Your girlfriend Sarah and your sister Emily. They should arrive within two hours." Hartley's expression softened slightly. "Sarah wants you to know she never stopped believing you were alive. Emily... well, your sister has some choice words for you about the heart attack you gave your mother."

Despite everything, Rusty smiled. "That sounds like Emily."

"Before you see them, I need to ask—did the Grays give you anything? Technology? Evidence? Anything to substantiate your claims?"

Rusty shook his head. "They said physical evidence would be confiscated or dismissed as fabrication. Better to let the evidence appear on its own when people start returning with powers. That's proof that can't be denied."

"Convenient," Hartley muttered.

"Strategic," Rusty corrected. "The Grays have been planning this intervention for centuries. They understand how humans think, how governments operate. They knew I'd be detained, debriefed, questioned. They knew you'd want evidence I couldn't provide. They accounted for all of it. That's why they chose this method—public revelation, immediate broadcast, impossible to completely suppress."

Hartley's phone buzzed insistently. He read the message and stood. "There's someone here who wants to meet you. Says he's been expecting this."

The ambulance door opened, and Vaughn Galloway stepped inside.

Rusty had never met the man in person, but he'd recognize that silver-streaked hair anywhere. Vaughn Galloway: billionaire entrepreneur, UFO enthusiast, founder of companies that existed in the gray zone between legitimate science and fringe speculation. If anyone on Earth was prepared to believe Rusty's story, it was this man.

"Mr. Richards," Galloway said, extending his hand. His grip was firm, his eyes sharp with intelligence. "I apologize for the intrusion, but when I heard your press conference, I dropped everything to get here. What you described—the Grays, the Alliance, the Living Superweapons—I've been preparing for something like this my entire life."

"You believe me," Rusty said. It wasn't a question.

"I've spent thirty years studying UFO phenomena, analyzing abduction reports, tracking patterns in satellite data that conventional scientists dismiss as noise." Galloway sat down across from Rusty. "I didn't know the specifics—I didn't know about the Grays or the Alliance of Four—but I knew something was coming. I've already begun preliminary work on a private organization to address extraterrestrial threats. I was calling it FIST—First Infantry Strike Team. But after hearing your suggestion about international cooperation, I think SPEAR has a better ring to it."

"Special Personnel for Extraterrestrial Assault and Research," Rusty said. Kor-Thalen had shown him this moment, had told him Vaughn Galloway was part of the plan.

"The government will fight you every step of the way," Hartley warned.

"The government will cooperate," Galloway countered smoothly, "because they'll have no choice. When people start appearing with abilities that make nuclear weapons look like firecrackers, traditional military structures won't be able to contain them. Better to work with someone who understands the threat than waste eight years playing jurisdictional games while humanity's extinction approaches." He turned back to Rusty. "I need everything the Grays told you. Every detail about the Alliance, about the enhancement process, about the invasion timeline. Will you work with me?"

Rusty studied the man who would become SPEAR's founder. Kor-Thalen had warned him: "Trust carefully. Not everyone who opposes the Alliance fights for humanity's good. Some fight for power. For control. For glory."

Looking into Galloway's eyes, Rusty saw ambition, brilliance, and hunger—but also determination. And they didn't have eight years to be picky about allies.

"I'll work with you," Rusty said. "On one condition: SPEAR answers to the world, not to one government or one corporation. If we're going to survive this, it has to be genuinely international."

"Agreed," Galloway said without hesitation. "Though making that happen will be its own kind of war."

"Better than the alternative."

Hartley's phone rang. He answered, listened, and stood. "Your family's helicopter is landing. I'll give you privacy for the reunion." He paused at the door. "Mr. Richards... I don't know if your story is true. But I hope to God it isn't. Because if you're right, we're in more danger than most people can comprehend."

"We are," Rusty confirmed. "But we have eight years. Eight years to prepare, to train, to become something more than what we are." He looked at Galloway. "Eight years to give humanity a fighting chance."

After Hartley left, Galloway pulled out a tablet and began taking notes. "I need you to walk me through the Alliance species. Start with—"

"Later," Rusty interrupted. Through the ambulance window, he could see a helicopter touching down on the football field, rotors kicking up dust and dried grass. The side door opened before it fully landed, and Sarah jumped out, her hair whipping in the downdraft, her face streaked with tears.

"We'll talk," Rusty said to Galloway. "But right now, I need to see the people I left behind."

He stepped out of the ambulance, and Sarah crashed into him like a wave, her arms wrapping around him so tightly he could barely breathe. She smelled like lavender shampoo and coffee and home. She was crying into his chest, saying his name over and over like a prayer.

Behind her, Emily emerged from the helicopter, moving slower, her eyes red but dry. She'd always been the strong one.

"You absolute bastard," Emily said when she reached him. Then she punched him in the shoulder—hard—and pulled him into a hug that made his ribs creak. "Two years, Rusty. Two goddamn years we thought you were dead."

"I know," he whispered. "I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."

"You better have a good explanation," Emily said fiercely. "And it better be better than 'aliens abducted me and sent me back to warn the world about an invasion.' Because even for you, that's—"

"It's true," Rusty interrupted. "Every word. I know how it sounds. But Emily, Sarah—" He pulled back enough to look at them both. "Everything I said in that press conference was true. In eight years, everything we know will end unless we fight. I need you to believe me."

Sarah touched his face gently, as if confirming he was real. "I believe you."

"I don't," Emily said bluntly. "But I believe that *you* believe it. And you've never lied to me before. So... I'll listen."

It wasn't faith. But it was a start.

As the sun set over Derby, painting the Australian sky in shades of orange and purple that painfully reminded Rusty of the vortex, he sat with his family in a military facility and told them everything. About the Grays' dimensional vessel. About Kor-Thalen and the other Gray scientists. About the Alliance of Four—the Iron Eaters with their self-evolving nanite bodies, the Slaught with their hive-mind swarms, the Deep with their ecosystem-destroying water manipulation, and the fourth species the Grays wouldn't name.

And about the Living Superweapons. The thousand men and women who would be chosen, enhanced, transformed. The powers they'd wield. The price they'd pay.

"Kor-Thalen showed me possible futures," Rusty said as darkness fell outside. "Not *the* future—they said time is more flexible than humans understand—but probable outcomes. I saw Earth burning. I saw our atmosphere processed into alien gas. I saw the last humans choking on toxic air, reaching for a sun they'd never see again."

He paused, looking at the faces of the women he loved.

"But I also saw another future. One where we fought back. Where these Living Superweapons stood against the Alliance and held the line long enough for humanity to evacuate. To survive. To scatter among the stars like seeds from a dying tree, carrying Earth's memory into the cosmos. That future is possible. Unlikely, but possible."

"Which future did the Grays think was most probable?" Sarah asked quietly.

Rusty met her eyes. "The one where we destroy ourselves before the Alliance even arrives. Where nations fight over the Living Superweapons instead of preparing for the invasion. Where fear and greed and pride blind us to the real threat until it's too late."

"Then we make sure that's not the future that happens," Emily said firmly. "You came back to warn us. Fine. Warning delivered. Now what?"

Now what, indeed.

Rusty thought of Vaughn Galloway, already planning SPEAR. Thought of the governments that would scramble to control the Living Superweapons. Thought of the eight years ticking away like a countdown to extinction.

"Now," he said, "we prepare for war."

## AUTHOR'S NOTE

This version follows the original Episode 0 concept where Rusty appears mysteriously in a field in Derby, Australia—no spaceship, no pod, just sudden materialization after two years missing. This creates more mystery and avoids the logistical problems of a spacecraft that would be immediately confiscated and studied by governments.

The Grays' method of return is deliberately unexplained, reinforcing that their technology operates beyond human understanding. Rusty's only "proof" is his alien clothing and the knowledge he carries—everything else must be validated by the appearance of Living Superweapons in the coming weeks.

Key changes from previous drafts:
- Removed the re-entry capsule entirely
- Rusty appears suddenly, standing in the middle of the field
- No physical craft for governments to seize and study
- Focus on Rusty's psychological state and the message delivery
- Maintains mystery about how Gray teleportation works
- Australian setting (Derby) instead of American
- Government response realistic but can't suppress the already-broadcast message
- Sets up Vaughn Galloway's SPEAR without making it feel rushed
