## Based on Creator Session (November 17, 2025)

## THE YEAR SYSTEM (8 Seasons = ~10 Years)

**IMPORTANT:** Years and Seasons are NOT the same thing
- The story spans approximately 10 years

## YEAR-BY-YEAR BREAKDOWN

---

### YEAR 2: THE SAGES
**Major Event:**
- **Sages revealed** - people with knowledge-based powers
- They have complete knowledge of ONE specific subject
- Like a college major - everything related to that topic
- BUT they have knowledge without experience
- Everything overlaps but they can't necessarily DO anything with it

### YEAR 4: IRON EATERS ARRIVE EARLY
**CRITICAL EVENT:**
- **Iron Eaters arrive as dust on a crashed satellite**
- NOT Year 8 - they come EARLY (4 years before expected)
- This is the "unspoken allegiance" of Alliance of Four

**Location:**
- Originally thought South America
- Reconsidering - maybe use science to determine most likely satellite crash location
- Don't want to give South America "the short end of the stick"

**Season Theme:**
- First contact with Alliance of Four
- Panic spreads
- Iron Eaters begin consuming metal infrastructure

**UN General Assembly:** Emergency session on Iron Eater threat

---

### YEAR 5 (~Estimate): THE IRON EATER WAR
**Major Event:**
- **Year-long war with Iron Eaters**
- Things progressively get worse
- Infrastructure collapsing
- Metal disappearing worldwide

**Turning Point Ideas (not finalized):**
- **Time traveler intervention** might help turn the tide
- **Deck 52 + SPEAR + [someone else]** work together
- **Something unprecedented** - cooperation never done before
- Need to figure out exact mechanism

**Season Theme:**
- **Apocalyptic feeling**
- **Paranoia**
- Desperate measures
- Unlikely alliances

**UN General Assembly:** [TBD - War strategy or ceasefire?]

---

### YEAR 6: GOVERNMENT CONTROL ATTEMPTS

**Season Theme:**
- Government overreach
- LSW rights vs security
- Rebellion and resistance
- Space as escape

**UN General Assembly:** LSW rights debate / China accusations

---

### YEAR 7-8: [TO BE DETERMINED]
**Possible Events:**
- Other Alliance of Four members arrive (Slaught, Deep, Strategist Race)
- Muo Sphere + Iron Eater interaction = **Nanovirus outbreak**
- Kaiser Eziobi assassination
- Spanish President attacks Turkey (after wife killed by Sandra/Jackal)
- Time traveler from future arrives (Asha traveling back?)

---

### YEAR 9-10: THE END

## RECURRING ELEMENTS

### UN General Assembly Speakers

- Different speaker each year
- Different major announcement or debate
- Tracks the evolution of global response

### Time Travelers
1. **Asha (India)** - Travels to FUTURE, ghost-like, slowly goes crazy
2. **Unnamed Chinese Team Member** - Travels to Liu Xiao's PAST, discovers loyalty pattern

### The Grays
- Rival species to Alliance of Four
- Abducted 1000 people worldwide
- Gave them superpowers
- **Hoped humanity would unite**
- **Were wrong** - humanity weaponized LSWs against each other

---

## MAJOR CONTRADICTIONS RESOLVED

### ❌ WRONG: 6 Alien Races
- COUNTRIES_SEASONS_AI.docx mentioned "6 alien races coming to extract oxygen"
- This was an **early draft idea that was abandoned**

### ✅ CORRECT: Alliance of Four
1. The Slaught
2. The Deep
3. The Strategist Race
4. Iron Eaters (unspoken allegiance)

### ✅ Kaiser's Age: 56 (not 32)
- Files confirm 56 years old
- Igbo helicopter pilot from Lagos

---

## STILL TO FIGURE OUT

1. **Satellite crash location** (Year 4)
   - Use science to determine most likely spot?
   - Avoid giving South America short end of stick

2. **How the tide turns** (Year 5)
   - Time traveler intervention?
   - Deck 52 + SPEAR + ??? cooperation
   - What unprecedented thing happens?

3. **Years 7-8 major events**
   - When do other Alliance members arrive?
   - When does nanovirus outbreak happen?
   - What other major deaths/events?

4. **The ending** (Years 9-10)
   - Win, lose, or ambiguous?
   - Final state of the world?

5. **UN General Assembly events**
   - What specific event/speaker each year?

---

## NOTES FOR DEVELOPMENT

- **Apocalyptic feeling** is key to Year 5 war
- **Paranoia** should permeate the Jackal era
- **Unprecedented cooperation** should feel earned and desperate
- **Each year should have a distinct "big thing"**
- **UN General Assembly can be narrative anchor** for each year's major shift
