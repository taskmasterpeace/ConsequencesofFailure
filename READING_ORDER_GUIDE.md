## HOW TO USE THE BATCH FILES (The Political/President Docs)

You said these are "absolutely fucking riveting" - they ARE! Here's how to enjoy them:

### DON'T:
❌ Try to read all at once
❌ Feel like you need to memorize them
❌ Read them before you're ready to write those regions

### DO:
✅ Pick a region that interests you TODAY
✅ Read those character profiles as SHORT STORIES
✅ Get inspired, take notes
✅ Write scenes featuring those characters while it's fresh

### EXAMPLE SESSION:
1. "I want to write about Uganda today"
2. Open BATCH_1, find Johnny Rain and Mugisha
3. Read their profiles (20 min) - riveting political drama!
4. Get hyped
5. Write scene: Johnny's stadium announcement or Mugisha's tanks

### THE "DESSERT STRATEGY":
- **While writing:** Reference BATCH files for character details
- **During breaks:** Read random country/president for fun
- **Weekly:** Dedicate 30 min to exploring a new region's profiles
- **Treat them as entertainment** - they're basically political thriller short stories!

## FILE TYPE GUIDE

**What you have:**

### .md files (Markdown)
- **NEW stuff we created together**
- Organized, polished, ready to use
- Open in any text editor
- Examples: BATCH files, CHARACTER files, CHAPTER_ORGANIZATION

### .txt files (Plain Text)

---

## SPECIAL NOTE: AVOID OVERWHELM

You have A LOT of content. That's GOOD - means rich universe!

But don't try to read everything before writing. That's paralysis.

**Instead:**
1. Read enough to understand the SYSTEM (Day 1 - 90 min)
2. Pick ONE character/storyline
3. Deep-dive JUST that character (Day 2 - 2 hours)
4. START WRITING (Day 3+)
5. Reference other docs as needed

**The BATCH files are DESSERT:**
- Read for enjoyment
- Read when writing that region
- Read during breaks
- Don't force yourself to finish them all before writing

---
