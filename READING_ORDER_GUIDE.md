# COF READING ORDER & SCHEDULE GUIDE
## Your Roadmap Through the Consequences of Failure Universe

---

## THE PROBLEM YOU HAVE

You just said the political/world leaders documents are **"absolutely fucking riveting"** - and they ARE! But they're also:
- 300KB-8.8MB in size (MASSIVE)
- 170 countries worth of content
- Thousands of characters
- Years worth of reading if done cover-to-cover

**You need a strategy, not a marathon.**

---

## THE GOLDEN RULES

1. **START WRITING EARLY** - Don't bog down in details before you begin
2. **READ BY REGION** - Deep-dive into countries/characters when you're writing their arc
3. **Use Political Docs as Databases** - Ctrl+F search, don't read cover-to-cover
4. **The Political Docs Are Dessert** - Save the "absolutely fucking riveting" stuff for when you're writing those specific storylines

---

## SPECIAL ADVICE: THE POLITICAL DOCUMENTS

### DO NOT:
❌ Try to read them cover-to-cover before writing
❌ Read them all in one sitting
❌ Feel obligated to absorb every detail before starting

### DO:
✅ **Use them as a database** - Ctrl+F search for what you need
✅ **Read by region** - Focus on countries relevant to current episode
✅ **Read as entertainment** - Dive into random country during breaks
✅ **Use for continuity** - Search before publishing to ensure consistency

---

## THE "DESSERT STRATEGY"

1. **While writing:** Only search for the specific country/leader you're featuring
2. **During breaks:** Pick a random country and read its profile for fun
3. **Weekly:** Dedicate 30 min to exploring a region
4. **Before major plot points:** Search all countries involved for consistency

### EXAMPLE WORKFLOW:
**Writing India-Pakistan border conflict scene:**
1. Open COUNTRIES_SEASONS_AI.docx
2. Search "India" - read section (10 min)
3. Search "Pakistan" - read section (10 min)
4. Search "Establishment 24" for continuity (5 min)
5. **Write the scene (2 hours)**
6. Take break: Read random leader profile for fun (15 min)

---

## ABSOLUTE MINIMUM (90 MINUTES) - "I WANT TO START NOW"

1. COF Notes (10 min) - Your premise
2. SHT_COF Timeline (8 min) - When things happen
3. Episode 0 (12 min) - How it all starts
4. COUNTRIES overview (15 min) - Global scope
5. **Pick ONE character arc** (30-45 min):
   - American: Stampede
   - African: Kaiser (temp_kaiser + temp_eziobi)
   - Asian: Liu Xiao + Establishment 24
   - Ugandan: Atlas Protocol

**Then START WRITING that character, using Tier 3/4 as reference.**

## THE CRITICAL DISTINCTION

### MUST-READ vs REFERENCE

**MUST-READ (Tier 1 + Tier 2):**
These give you the **mental model** of your universe. Read sequentially.

**REFERENCE (Tier 3 + Tier 4):**
These give you **details** for specific scenes. Search as needed.

**Think of it like:**
- **Tier 1 & 2** = Learning to drive (must do before getting on road)
- **Tier 3 & 4** = GPS and road signs (consult while driving)

---

## FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**For Maximum Efficiency:**
1. **Week 1:** Read Tier 1 & Tier 2 (~5 hours)
2. **Week 2:** Start writing Episode 1 of first character arc
3. **As you write:** Open relevant Tier 3 docs for details
4. **Never:** Try to read 8.8MB before writing a single word

**Your universe is MASSIVE. That's a feature, not a bug.**

The political documents are "absolutely fucking riveting" **because** they're dense, detailed, and immersive. But trying to memorize everything before writing is like trying to memorize an atlas before a road trip.

**Instead:**
- Learn the **rules of the road** (Tier 1)
- Meet the **main travelers** (Tier 2)
- Consult the **GPS as you go** (Tier 3/4)
